1 "ANCIENT CITY OF AURORA" AURORA~
Suggested level range: 15 - 35
 
Legend speaks of a mystical city isolated from all civilization by a 
magical barrier. This city, Aurora, can now be accessed through a portal
that was ripped through the barrier connecting it to the Realms.  Why 
such a portal was opened, no one knows, but if legend holds true this city
is to be full of treasures and knowledge uncomparable to any of that which
exists. Aurora now stands ready for curious individuals to explore its
streets and meet its citizens.

1 "BARRIKS KEEP" BARRIKS~
Recommended Level Range: 25 - 50

Atop a great mountain, sits a small run down village. It is surrounded
by mountains and large trees that have been in existence for untold
centuries. The village is guarded by a few loyal citizens who remain
due to loyalty. The townspeople hide a secret passage that leads to the
keep. A large forest enshrouds the area and prevents it's notice to 
the outside world.
~

51 "BOWERS PARK" "BOWERS GARDENS"~
Recommended Level Range: 1 - 15

The Bowers Park and Gardens, located along the northeast edge of
Darkhaven, was commissioned by Duke Luther for the patrons of his
fine city. The park is frequently filled with children and has many
areas to play in. Unfortunately, the Park was built on a strip
of land that many said was cursed. During the daytime, the Duke
guarantees the safety of all that reside in the park. After
nightfall however, anything can happen.

~

57 "MASSIGN" "OASSIGN" "RASSIGN"~
&YSyntax&W: (r/m/o)assign <character> <begin vnum range> <end vnum range>
 
These commands allow you to assign a range of vnums to an immortal for
so that they may build inside that range.  Use the 'checkvnums' command
before assigning a range to ensure that there will be no vnum conflicts.
You can also use the 'vnums' command for a complete list of currently
allocated ranges, and the 'newzones' command for a complete list of
prototype vnum ranges.
 
The Freevnums help file has been implemented to assist assigners with
giving out vnums. Checking Freevnums is a must before performing any
assignments. Give out the wrong vnums and we kill you.
 
Warning!  *Never* assign any vnums to a character who has another vnum
range assigned to them via 'aassign'.  Simply be sure to have the
character type 'aassign none' before assigning vnums to them.
 
If you need vnums assigned to a character who already has a proto area
assigned to them, have them start a new character, or clear their old
vnums buffer as written above. This will, however, destroy their old
area unless it is installed.

51 "PALLINDROME HALL"~
Pallindrome Hall, a castle named lovingly for it's creator, Paelus, came into 
existence a year after the arrival of the New Pantheon. This major shift in
the balance of Despair's ethical and spiritual system left many without 
guidance, or order; thus, rumor has it Paelus opened the doors to the many
wanderers and beasts, as long as they sought his guidance. There are even 
rumors of a council of the representatives of Light within the central hall.
The crimson hue of the exterior walls distract the average adventurer's 
attention from his stunning surroundings within the Deep Oak. The Oak was 
blessed recently by the deity Cabal, for a portion of the Hall is devoted to 
him; and so the forest takes on a visage of miraculous supernaturality as one 
walks among them.
~

0 "REMOVE INVIS"~
Syntax: cast 'remove invis' <object>
 
This spell will make an invisible object in the character's inventory
visible.

This is an AGGRESSIVE spell when used on others. I.e, it will attack 
another player if you attempt to use it on them.
~

1 "REUNION AUCTION"~
&b-&B=&C>&WSlave for the Cure Auction&C<&B=&b-
&B
&BIn the civilized world, the practice of owning slaves is considered
&Bbarbarous and inhumane.  It deprives a human being of their free will
&Band basic rights, forcing them to cater to the slaveowner's every wish
&Band tawdry whim.
&B
&CSound like fun to you?  Us too.

&BIn order to help raise money for Moonbeam's &w'Run for the Cure' &B(Help

1 "SOUL PETRIFICATION" SOUL PETRIFICATION~
&YSyntax&W: cast 'soul petrification' self
 
This increases the caster's fortitude, making him/her a tougher opponent
in battle.  This is an aggressive spell when cast on others.
~

1 "THE ISLAND OF IRRYBIS" IRRYBIS~
The Valley of the Elves lies far to the north of Darkhaven. Deep within
this Valley lies the Island of Irrybis surrounded by the crystal blue
waters of the Azzurian Sea. It is said that the Elven capital city of
Arborlon resides in the center of this Island, welcoming all those of
Elven Kin to visit and stay.

~

1 "THE SANDS OF TERACCHEI" SANDS OF TERACCHEI GITHTOWN~
Roughened by the harsh desert winds of Teracchei, the gith who make their
homes in this harsh plane have scraped up a meager existence. Run by a cruel
githyanki Queen, the inevitable struggle between the benevolent githzerai
and the demonic githyanki pushes the civilization closer to collapse and
ruin. Only the pirates of the gith profit through the turmoil, collecting
and selling trophies of the war to both side. Unwelcoming of visitors, few have
glimpsed the heartbreaking beauty of the githyanki sandstone towers, each of
which reflect the weath and power that is jealously hoarded in a meager attempt
to create a more palatable life.
~

1 "TRIBAL SWAMPLANDS"~
Deep in the heart of the Haon Dor forest, near the darkened marsh lies
the entrance to the realm of lizardmen. It is said that these elusive
creatures gather here to chant in a tribal ritual, which often requires
the devouring of human flesh. Guarded by their own kind, the lizardmen
can come together here safely, without fear of intrusion by their enemies.

1 "VILE BIDDING" VILE BIDDING~
&YSyntax&W: cast 'vile bidding'
 
You use your wisdom to summon forth a familiar to do your evil dirty
work.

1 'A MOMENT IN NATURE'~
Recommended level range: 2 - 20

Curious young adventurers, feeling safe within the boundaries of the academy,
are often lulled into a sense of safety therein. Some become brazen enough to
enter the whirling mystical portal found within the confines of the grounds
where battle skills are honed. The portal is sustained with Druidic magic,
renewed in strength by natural forces within the portal itself. An overwhelming
urge can be felt near the portal to perhaps take a break from the constant
dread of wolves and slime of slugs...to perhaps take a hike, climb a tree, or
enjoy a picnic lunch.
~

53 AASSIGN~
Syntax: aassign <filename>.are  Example:  aassign edo.are
 
AASSIGN temporarily assigns all rooms, objects, and mobiles in the area
range to your pfile.  This allows you to use rlist, olist, mlist, and
reset list.  This also means that typing savearea, reset area, or 
instazone will affect this area.  
 
To save changes permenantly, type "aassign none" and foldarea.
 
&rWarning&w!! Do not have an area aassigned to yourself when getting personal
vnums assigned to you.  The personal vnums will overwrite the area file.
 
In order to assign a proto area to yourself, you must either have that
area bestowed to you by a Greater God or higher.
 
In order to assign a nonproto area to yourself, you must either have
that area bestowed to you by an Exalted+. Even if you have the area bestowed
only Lesser+ can aassign themselves nonproto areas.
~

1 'ABATTOIR ASYLUM'~
Recommended level range: 35 - 50
Once a monument to health and sanity, the Abbot Hill Asylum has been
corrupted over the years and now lies in a state of irreparable decay.
Located on a large isle in the Blood Sea, the insane and dying were once
brought there to be healed and cared for. Unfortunately, it seems that the
priests in care of these decrepit souls were infected by the same lack of
sanity they were attempting to cure. What was once a place of peace and
salvation has become a haven of the damned, ruled by chaos unbridled.
~

1 ACCESSORIES~
Syntax:  accessories <argument>
 
Where the argument is one of:
 list
 show <# of accessory>
 buy <# of accessory>
 
Accessories may be added to your house to decorate.  These commands allow you
to view and purchase the approved accessories.
 
See Also:  HOUSE, SELLHOUSE, HOMEBUY, HOUSING
~

1 'ACETUM PRIMUS'~
'Acetum Primus,' is the third and most powerful of the known acid
disciplines at the Mage's disposal.  This incantation pulls forth the
strongest caustic agents in the casting Mage's neighboring planes,
and propels them in a tight cyclone-like blast towards the Mage's
chosen victim.  The cross-dimensional disturbance, the physical
violence, and the bonescouring potency of the conjured compound all
work together to effect an estimable attack.
~

1 'ACID BLAST' 'BURNING HANDS' 'COLOUR SPRAY' FIREBALL 'LIGHTNING BOLT'
  'MAGIC MISSILE' 'SHOCKING GRASP'~
These are all attack spells and should not be used against another player
unless both you and the other player are listed under 'who deadly' and are
within the legal pkill level range.

1) Syntax:  cast fireball         <victim>
2) Syntax:  cast 'acid blast'     <victim>
3) Syntax:  cast 'lightning bolt' <victim>
4) Syntax:  cast 'colour spray'   <victim>
5) Syntax:  cast 'shocking grasp' <victim>
6) Syntax:  cast 'burning hands'  <victim>
7) Syntax:  cast 'magic missile' <dir> <victim>
 
Each of these spells inflict variable damage on the victim.  The higher the
caster's level, the more damage inflicted.  The spells are listed by their
inherent power from strongest to weakest, though differences in strength
are in many cases minimal.
~

0 'ACID BREATH' 'FIRE BREATH' 'FROST BREATH' 'GAS BREATH' 'LIGHTNING BREATH'~
Syntax: cast 'acid breath'      <victim>
Syntax: cast 'fire breath'      <victim>
Syntax: cast 'frost breath'     <victim>
Syntax: cast 'gas breath'
Syntax: cast 'lightning breath' <victim>

These spells are for the use of dragons.  Acid, fire, frost, and lightning
damage one victim, whereas gas damages every PC in the room.  Fire and
frost can break objects, and acid can damage armor.

High level mages may learn and cast these spells as well.
 
Be aware that area attacks are aggressive to all mobs in the room,
including pets, mounts and charmed creatures.
Gas breath is an area attack, the other breath spells are not.

53 ACTIONDESC~
&wAll of the variables listed as "actor" - $n, e, m, s - will all show "you"
to the character doing the action, and show the appropriate variable to the
other characters in the room.
 
Neat little additions - $q = When added to the end of a word will show an "s"
to other characters in the room, and not the person doing the action, eg:
"$n eat$q the apple." would be:
To char:  You eat the apple.
To room:  John eats the apple.
 
If you want a capital You in the mid sentence.. like
 
You eat the apple.  You find it delicious and tasty.
 
The normal $ variables won't do the trick.  So use the variable %s. For
instance:
 
$n eat$q the apple.  %s find$q it delicious and tasty.

1 AD ADS ADVERTISING~
&GAdvertisement and discussion of other muds needs to be done in 
private -- not in channels, titles, descriptions, bios, on
note boards (other than the mail board, though unsolicited
mail is similarly banned) or unsolicited tells.

We have been exceedingly lenient on this, but too many people
are taking advantage of it, aggravating both immortals and
mortals alike.  If you are asked to desist and do not do so
immediately your play on this mud will be terminated.
 
Many of those advertising are actually running Smaug muds,
and we find this particularly disturbing.  We have released
a large, flexible and substantial MUD engine for free public
use, and have included a complement of areas to get you
started.  We encourage new muds to grow and to develop.
If you want to advertise your Smaug mud, add it to the Smaug Mud
list at http://www.game.org/smaug/mudlist.html

All we ask in return is that we are given the respect of not
having new muds running the code and areas we created come to
our own mud and behave this way.  Since we are often not
given this respect, we will begin dealing extremely harshly
with those who cannot see their way to such simple and civil
guidelines.

51 ADMINLIST~

&cSyntax: adminlist
 
&gThe adminlist command is designed to make finding the right immortal
you may need easier. It is arranged first by level of the immortal,
then alphabetically. Names with asterisks around them signify the
head and/or co-head of the councils.

60 ADVANCE~
Syntax: advance <character> <level>

ADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the
only way to create new immortal characters within the game.  ADVANCE
may also be used to demote characters.
~

53 ADVANCEDEXITS~
SMAUG supports having more than one exit in the same direction, as well as
the special direction 'somewhere', represented by a '?'.
 
If you already have an exit leading north, and would like another one, use
a plus sign '+' in front of the direction:
  redit exit +n 3001          - Adds another exit north to room 3001
 
To modify an extra exit like this, or to remove it, you'll have to refer to
it by number:
  redit exit #2 3002          - Change the second exit to go to room 3002
  (to know what number an exit is, do an "rstat")
 
For someone to be able to use the second north exit, you have to set one of
the extra flags (see EXFLAGS) like CAN_CLIMB.  It's also usually a good idea
to set the HIDDEN flag for any special exit so that it looks nicer to those
with autoexits on.
 
The AUTO flag makes it possible to go in a direction by simply typing the
keyword for that exit:
  redit exit ? 3001           - Create a 'somewhere' exit to 3001
  redit exflags ? auto hidden - Set the proper flags
  redit exname ? swim         - Set the keyword "swim"
  ... here, if a player types 'swim' in the room they will move to room 3001

1 AFFECTED 'AFFECTED BY'~
Syntax:  affected       (abbrevation:  af)
Syntax:  affected by    (abbreviation: af by)
 
'Affected' is a spells-at-a-glance function, which displays only the spells
(and skill affects) your character is currently under.  Each affect will be
listed by name only for the sake of brevity (if you want to know what each
is doing, use help <spell/skill name> or 'score').
 
Characters level 20 or above and deadly characters will also see the number
of rounds remaining for each affect.  Affects with a remaining lifespan of
less than 25 rounds are displayed in white, and those in immediate danger
of wearing off will flash.
 
'Affected by' displays a character's affects separate from its spell/skill
affect list.  This is useful for ensuring that affects given from equipment
are actually functioning.  For example, if you are wearing a visor with
detect_invis but 'affected by' does not show you as having that affect, you
are not detecting invisibility.
 
'Affected by' also displays your current susceptibilities, resistances and
immunities if your character is level 20 or higher.
~

51 AFFECTEDBY AFFECTED_BY~
The following are affect flags that can be used when osetting an item
(with oset <item> affect affected <affect flag>).  These flags can also
be used when msetting a mobile (mset <mob name> affected <affect flag>).
They may additionally be used to mset players if your level allows it.

Syntax:  afk (abbreviation for "away from keyboard")
 
The 'afk' command will place an [AFK] flag beside your name on the who 
list when activated, as well as informing those who send tells that you
you are afk.  It can be toggled on or off by typing afk, and will also
go off automatically when you enter any command.
 
~

1 AGGRESSIVE~
Syntax: style aggressive
 
This style of combat allows a fighter to strike more effectively, but
leaves many holes in his defenses as well. Fighters who know this tactic
can strike enemies for more damage, but their enemies' weapons will slip
through their defenses for slightly more damage as well.
 
See Also: style, evasive, defensive, standard, aggressive, berserk
~

0 AID~
Syntax: aid <character>

This skill allows you to bring a stunned person back into consciousness.
The skill will only work on those who are low in hitpoints or stunned by
a non-combat action.  A character paralyzed via combat can not be aided.
~

1 ALERTNESS~
Syntax:  c alertness <self>
 
Alertness renders the target resistant to the sleep spell.
~

1 ALIGNMENT ALIGN ZAPPING~
Your alignment can range from +1000 to -1000. When you are +1000 this
means that you are good aligned, when you are -1000 this means you are
evil aligned, and when you are 0 aligned this means you are neutral.
You can change your alignment by killing good or evil aligned mobs.
This will raise or lower your alignment.

The different alignments will allow you to wear different pieces of
equipment. If you are good aligned and try to wear a piece of equipment
which is antigood, you will be zapped, which means the piece of eq will
fall to the ground. The same occurs when you are evil and you try to
wear an antievil piece of eq, or if you are neutral and try to wear
an antineutral piece of eq. You can also be zapped during battle if you
are fighting a mob opposite of your align.

You can find out what your alignment is by typing SCORE.

Answer:   poisoned weapons are decaying
 
Comment:  ok ok peeps.. one more time:  me avatar.  me starving
  but cannot see it.  me recharge verrrrrrrry slowwwwwly
  [this person subsequently threatened to leave the mud and take
  people with him because we wouldn't fix such "bugs"]
Answer:   you could try typing 'score' to see your hunger and
  thirst.  Avatars used to see their thirst and hunger messages,
  but then nobody liked that and everyone wanted them removed.
  The idea of a config +/- hunger_and_thirst_messages seems
  ridiculous to me.  Not many people have a problem keeping
  track by using score, they just pay attention.
 
Comment:  this area bites, we need areas with mobs in them not
  pretty descs
Answer:  what "we need" varies.  I'd be an idiot to refuse any
  area that fit any of our needs, be they killing fields or
  social zones or transition areas or what-have-you.  Work on
  one has nothing to do with work on another.

1 ANTALL~
Recommended level range: 35 to 50


Following centuries of relative peace in Ocean Keep, a mighty storm
ravaged the harbor contained within.  An old demon, at rest since before
the time Faragut made his mark, awoke from a deep slumber that had
neutralized his evils.  His ship, the Deilstorm, arose from the darkened
sea that had, for so long, left no trace of his past.  Faragut does not
know what terror really can be.
~

1 ANTARCTICA~
Recommended level range: 10 - 30

The frozen wastes of Antarctica lie far to the south of Darkhaven,
separated from the main continent by a vast ocean. Hidden in this
land of ice is the town of Little Haven. Two great heroines of Light rule
over the gnomes of this town: the Shieldmaiden Brunhilde and the Snow
Queen. The gnomes have created deadly frost giants to aid in the 
protection of the town and have also enlisted the aid of a fearsome blue
dragon. It is a comforting thought that very little threat arises from
Antarctica, for the Realms of Despair are already dark enough...

1 APPEALS~
If you feel that you've been treated _too_ harshly you have the option
of an appeal. To do so you must post a note to the oracle with the             
following information:

(1)  Name of the Character:  the name of the punished character.  NOT an
alternate, your brother's or your friend's character.
 
(2)  The Offence:  The reason why you were punished.
 
(3)  The Name of the Immortal who gave the Punishment.
 
(4)  The Punishment.
 
(5)  Why you feel the punishment given is _too_ harsh.
 
 
Please be aware that if your request is frivolous, not grounded in fact
or an outright lie the punishment can INCREASE.  Also be aware that the
Immortal involved in dispensing the punishment will be contacted prior
to a determination being made.
 
N.B.  Do NOT contact the Council of Elders (either individually or
collectively, either via tell or email) without first launching an appeal
via the process set out above.  If for any reason you are unable to post
to the oracle you may email Darrek at darrek@game.org.
~

53 APPEAR~
&YSYNTAX: &wAppear <target> <target> ....
        Appear none
 
Target may be a clan abbreviation, council abbreviation, "room", or a player
name.
 
This allows you to become visible to your specified target, regardless of your
wizinvis level. Repeating the command for a different target will make you
again invisible to the previous targets, while becoming visible to the new
targets. The target sees that someone has appeared before them. You no
longer must be in the room with the targets in order to appear before them.
Using the 'none/nobody/clear' argument clears all appearances.
~

0 APPRAISE~
Syntax: appraise <item>
        appraise all

Appraise, when at a repairshop type mob, will tell you the condition of 
your equipment in question.  The mob will tell you if it needs repair or 
not, and if so, how much it will cost.
 
~

1 'AQUA BREATH' 'AQUA'~
Syntax: cast 'aqua breath' <character>
 
This spell allows you to breath in water areas and underwater.  Certain
water sectors will require the use of aqua breath to prevent damage from
drowning.  If you are in an area and your movement suddenly begins to
drop and/or you begin losing hps <hitpoints>, you should either cast
aqua breath immediately or leave the area.
 
~

1 ARACHNOS~
Recommended level range: 5 - 20

A large amount of Haon Dor's treetops is covered in a sticky film:
the webs of a thousand spiders. The realm of Arachnos, as it is called
by Darkhaven's adventurers, is a series of twisting, intricate webs
populated by arachnids and spiders. Some say that this fear-filled place
is named Arachnos after the name of its hideous ruler. The stories tell
of a dragon housed deep within the area, answering to the name of Yevaud.

1 ARCANES~
.
                      &W-(&R*&W)- &RAs One, We Are Strong &W-(&R*&W)-
&w
That is our motto, and for it we fight.   The Ancient Order of Arcanes is
an elite group of practitioners of the Magicks with a long and honorable
history dating far back into the days of the old clans, when the Arcanes,
one of the earliest of the peaceful clans, stood apart from the fray and
strove to hold the beacon of light and knowledge proudly aloft in a
darkening world.  We have lived on in the heart of the Realms through
many centuries of peace and war.
 
Arcanes try to master the knowledge of the ever-changing world about them.
With knowledge comes power, and with power responsibility.  Our magicks
are strong, and rarely do we taste defeat.  But we use our strength and
power to help one another; and where we can do no good in the world abroad,
we at least strive to do no harm.  Members live by, and live up to, a
demanding Code of Conduct which requires teamwork and cooperation among
members, and honor and fair dealing in the outside world.  The Arcanes
reside in a castle created out of the fabric of magic itself, which stands
as a testimony to Arcanes' power and strength.
 
Order members' solidarity and coordination are unrivalled.  Almost every
day, and frequently more than once in a day, the Order conducts some
activity to which all members are invited -- whether simple exploring/
mobkilling, practicing pk, questing among ourselves, or participating as
a team in mudwide quests -- for mutual benefit and enjoyment.  To the
extent possible, these events are held at different times of the day, to
permit the widest possible participation.

Those who distinguish themselves in such activities are regularly rewarded
from the Order Treasury.  The Order also continually seeks to reward those
who seek out knowledge and put it to the use of the Order.

1 AREAS~
Syntax:  areas
Syntax:  areas old
Syntax:  areas <low range> <hi range>
 
The 'areas' command displays an alphabetically sorted list of all areas
within the game, together with the author and suggested level range of
each area.  
 
The 'areas old' command displays an unsorted list of all areas (the old
style), as well as the author and suggested level range of each area.
 
You can specify a level range to see a list of all areas with suggested
ranges which encompass the argument.  This can be a little awkward as
each area has a low and a high suggested range.  Suffice to say that if
an area's level range matches even one level of the range you request,
it will be displayed.
 
Special thanks to Fireblade for design and coding of this restyled function.
The Realms of Despair will provide a copy of areas built by individuals
to that individual and no one else. To receive a copy of an area for use
on other muds, you must contact that individual.
 
~

0 ARMOR~
Syntax: cast armor <character>

This spell decreases (improves) the armor class of the target character
by 20 points.
~

53 ARMORCLASS~
Armor class should play a much more important role in character and mob crea-
tion than it currently does.  You would not dare venture out on the streets
in a table top roleplay with a poor armor class. You would quickly become mon-
ster fodder, and your friends would all laugh as you recreate your charac-
ters.
 
The scale for armor class goes from 19 to -19. First thing to remember is that
the lower the score, the better the armor class. Please remember that as I go
through this portion of the lesson.
 
In SMAUG, if a players armor class shows in his score as a -270. When it comes
time for something to take a swing at him, the code divides that by 10, and any
AC less than -19 is turned into -19. So the question arises, why have an AC of
less than -190?  How about faerie fire, or for that matter any armor class 
altering spell?  The code doesn't divide by 10 until after the modifiers are 
all added into the equation.
 
                EXAMPLE: A player with a -270 armor class adds 100 for his
                 avatar level "faerie fire" now has a -170, divided
                 by 10, equals -17.
 
This is quite simply why it makes no sense to have an armor class on your mobs
less than the -300 maximum. It would simply be a wasted number.
 
SEE NEXT:  HELP THAC0
~

52 ARMORCLASS~
.
&gThere are two values used with armor class for object type Armor:
 
&GValue0: Variable amount based on level of item at repop.
Value1: Maximum repairable armor setting for the object.
 
Setting Value0 controls the default value an item will pop with. Not setting
Value0 will cause it to adjust itself based on the level of the weapon at
repop. Setting Value1 below the expected/default repop value for Value0 will
result in an item that cannot be repaired until Value0 drops below Value1.
The listing below gives you a rough approximation of the values returned for
Value0 based on level:
 
&GLevel Invoked   Value0   Level Invoked   Value0   Level Invoked   Value0 
-------------   ------   -------------   ------   -------------   ------   
      1           1-3         10           3-5         20           6-8
     30           8-10        40          11-13        50          13-15
     
&gThe amount that Value0 is set to determines the amount the player's A.C. will
be adjusted. Different wear locations have a different multiplying affect:
 
&G0 X Value0: Wield, Ears.
1 X Value0: Arms,  Finger, Neck, Feet, Hands, Shield, Waist, Wrist, Hold, Eyes.
2 X Value0: Head,  Legs,   About.
3 X Value0: Body.

&CContinued from page "Help As Inductions".
 
&G5. If a Guide decides to accept an application, (s)he conducts a 
   preliminary interview and assigns a knowledge quest, and the applicant 
   should assume the title of [Candidate] on the questing character.  
   Applicants may ask for advice and information on their knowledge quest, 
   but should perform the quest alone with the questing character, except 
   with the Arbiter's express permission.  Submitting items given, traded 
   for, or bought (except from shopkeeper's regular stock) is cheating.  
   The candidate has  two weeks to complete the item quest.  This period 
   may be extended only by the Arbiter and only in special circumstances.  
   The items or other proof of completion should be turned into the 
   assigning Guide, or the Arbiter.
 
&C6. Besides the quest, the inductions process requires a vote of the full 
   Order after members have had an opportunity to comment on the 
   application, so candidates should be prepared for a few weeks' wait.  
   In the meantime, any inquiries should be directed to the Guide who 
   accepted their application, the Arbiter or Justiciar, or a coded 
   leader.  Candidates will be notified of the outcome of their 
   application by mudmail.

This collaboration of mortal entities is oriented towards achieving their
goals through law and order. They have weaved for themselves a highly
structured society. Yet they maintain a great love for the Ethereal, the
plane from which all mystical beings, even gods, arise. Within this strata,
they feel closer to the secrets of the ever-shifting cosmos, and gain great
power and knowledge by their interactions with it.
&G
It is through a unity at once mortal and ethereal that the Ascendere rise above
the fray to illuminate the obscure corners of the Realms with the lamp of
knowledge; to bring system, structure, and order to the unfathomable ether;
and to assail the agents of chaos, subjecting them to their organized will.

Syntax:  cast 'portal'       <victim>  Syntax:  cast 'helical flow' <victim>
 
These spells allow the very shape of space and time to be warped at the
caster's bidding:
 
'Astral walk' instantaneously moves the caster to the victim's location.
 
'Farsight' allows you to see the room in which the victim stands.
 
'Portal' forms a temporary tunnel through space to the victim.  A portal
will not succeed if a portal already exists in either the caster's or
the victim's location.  Type 'enter' or 'enter portal' to pass through.
Care should be taken as these portal locations could be dangerous indeed.
Portals should not be created from or to Darkhaven or the Academy.
 
'Helical Flow' morphs an Augurer into a coil of colour which instantly
travels to the victim's location.
 
These spells may fail if either the victim or the caster is in a location
which blocks their use, such as no-recall areas, no-summon areas, etc.

&PAttacker &Wflags are automatically given by the mud code to players
who engage in illegal attacks upon other players. These attacks can
initiated by using MURDER, casting an attack spell, or ordering
followers to attack a player. Deadlies attacking Deadlies do not
receive Attacker Flags. These flags are only given out in situations
that involve Peaceful players, i.e. Deadlies attacking Peacefuls,
(or vice versa), or Peacefuls attacking Peacefuls. You will be
tagged with an &PAttacker &Wflag if:
 
  1. You attempt to MURDER another player, or they attempt to
  MURDER you. (See &CHelp Murder &Wand &GLaws Pkill &Wfor more info
  on attacking other players).
 
  2. You order charmed mobiles or pets to attack a player, or you
  are attacked by another players mobiles. (See &CHelp Charm &Wor
  &CHelp Pets &Wfor more info)>
 
  3. You are a &RDeadly &Wplayer and attacked a fellow Clanmember.

&WDarkhaven Guards, shopkeepers and special function mobs now respond
differently to illegal flags. You may find yourself barred from making
purchases, placed before Judge Kendra for a hearing, or sentenced to
jail. Should you acquire an &PAttacker &Wor any other illegal activity

The auction command is used for performing auctions.  Simply typing auction
will display the current item being auctioned, if there is one.  
Please keep in mind that auctioning balls of light and recalls may be stopped
by an immortal.
 
If nothing is being auctioned, auction <item name> <starting value> will 
begin an auction.  If no starting value is specified, it begins at 0 gold.
 
Auction bid <value> will place a bet for the item.
 
Special thanks to Erwin Andreasen for writing this function.
(Ported to Realms of Despair from a publicly available source.)
 
At the present, if the mud crashes in mid auction, you will lose both 
your bidded money and the item.  This will at some point be fixed.
 
You are able to see auction almost from the point of character creation,
however, you cannot USE auction unless you're level FIVE or higher. To remove
the auction channel from your screen, type CHANNEL -AUCTION.

au bid 20k500   - bids 20500 coins (20,000 + 500)
au bid 20k5003  - bids 20500 coins, too (only checks first 3 chars after "k")
au bid 1m       - bids 1 million coins
 
On an existing bid of 10000:
au bid +10       - adds 10%, making the bet 11000.
au bid +         - adds 25% (the default if no number given), bet is 12500.
au bid x         - multiplies by 2, making the bet 20000.
au bid x5        - multiplies by 5, making the bet 50000.
au bid x <item>  - auc bid 10k sword would bid 10k on a sword
 
It is illegal to auction <or barter, sell, trade> clan, order, or guild items.

0 AUGURER AUGURERS~
The Augurer is very strong-minded in its nature, both physically and
magically. It is very confident of its actions in combat, and this
confidence shows in its physical appearance.  The Augurer is of a
medium height, with a defined bone structure which shows both
intelligence and assurance.  Its appearance is wizened, but at times
the Augurer may look frail due to exhaustion.  Though it is of a
medium size, its physical strength is not.  The Augurer relies on
both brain and brawn to overcome its challengers.  When it is
confronted, its wisdom decides what course of action it should take,
and wisdom is its prime stat.
 
While in combat, the Augurer is capable of utilizing both spells and
skills to their greatest potential.  However, because of the Augurer's
size, it tires of magic easily.  To overcome this mental exhaustion,
the Augurer is a strong believer in the use of mana for rejuvination
of its magical powers, and uses a lot of it.  In its spare time, the
Augurer enjoys the local lore, both the teaching and learning of it,
as well as musical and theatrical pursuits.  The Augurer is a very
independent person, and spends much of its spare time in meditation,
reflecting upon the days activities.
 
The following races are acceptable to the ways of the Augurer:
Human Elf Dwarf Half-Troll Gith Drow Sea-Elf Gnome

1 AV AVATAR AVATARS~
An avatar is a character who has improved themselves as far as is mortally
possible - level 50. When a character reaches this level, they automatically
become an Avatar and this is announced across the entire realms.
Avatars enjoy many advantages. For example, the avatar can survive happily
without ever needing to eat or drink, though hunger and thirst do still affect
regeneration.  Avatars also do not gain or lose experience.
Note that an Avatar character is different from a supplicated Avatar mobile.
see: HELP SUPPLICATE.
 
Avatars have their own channel, AV. This channel is not changed by
chan +/- all, but by chan +/- AVATAR.  It may be used by typing
'av message' or ':message'.

1 BACKFIRE~
Magical items (pills, potions, staffs, wands) which cast offensive spells
have a chance of backfiring if the character using them is much lower in
level than the spell level on the item.
 
For example, a level 15 character trying to invoke a wand with level 50
fireball may injure themselves when the spell backfires.
 
~

1 BACKSTAB BS~
Syntax:  backstab <victim>
Syntax:  bs       <victim>
 
A backstab is a method of attack, used primarily by thieves but able
to be utilized by others in some circumstances, and which inflicts a
tremendous degree of damage on unsuspecting victims if successful.
 
An appropriate weapon type is required to backstab, and if your victim
is wounded or suspicious it may not be possible to surprise them.  The
most important factor in anyone's ability to backstab is to catch the
victim when they are unaware of your presence.

51 BAMFIN BAMFOUT~
Syntax: bamfin  <message>
Syntax: bamfout <message>

The standard messages for GOTO are 'arrives in a swirling mist' and
'leaves in a swirling mist'.  You can replace these messages with messages of
your own choosing using the BAMFIN and BAMFOUT commands.

58 'BAN 50'~
Seeking to ban a site above level 1 should be an extremely rare situation. One
in which the actions of one or more key persons from a site are deemed to be
a detriment to the enjoyment of a large portion of the players in the game.
Such person(s) are generally deemed to be beyond rehabilitation at this time.
 
When seeking to ban a site, make use of the Grub command to both see the impact
of the ban, and to get a list of all character names from the site. You can use
this list to keep an eye out for these characters coming in from other sites,
as it's obvious these days that a site ban may not always cure the situation.
 
All site bans above level one should be set at level 50 or higher. It should be
a rare instance in which a site is banned at some in between level. Only in the
direst of instances would a site be banned above level 50, as this will affect
immortal level players as well.

58 'BAN DURATION'~
The standard set for ban durations are as follows:
 
Newbie Ban:          1) One week on first instance.
                     2) Two weeks for the second.
                     3) One month at newbie, or level 50 for third.
                     4) Permanent at newbie, or level 50 for 4th offense.
 
Bans for level 2-50: 1) One month for first instance.
                     2) Two months, or permanent for 2nd.
                     3) Permanent for 3rd offense.
 
All bans above level 50 should be permanent by their very nature.
 
&WReminder - Without documenting each time we ban a site, we will have no
           source of history on sites. Always remember to post a note
           detailing the reasons for the ban.&w

58 'BAN NEWBIE'~
Banning a site is a form of last resort, as it not only affects the offending
player or players, but will also affect every other player from that site.
Before seeking to ban a site, even for a temporary level 1 banning, make
sure you have exhausted all other options first. 
 
In the case of newbie bans, most such instances arise through the actions of 
one or more abusive players who log in a newbie and begin swearing, spamming, 
threatening, etc.. Many times this has developed from an immature player's 
frustrations over getting a name authed. If you find a player going through a 
series of silly names trying to auth them, make every effort to try and talk 
with them first. If this fails, use Fquit to discourage them. If you have 
Disconnect, use this instead, as it is less provoking than fquit (makes it 
appear as if they simply lost their conneection). If they continue their 
efforts, send them warnings to get their attention. Use freeze if you have it 
(or if someone else is on who can use it) to get their attention and make sure 
received the message. Then, and only then, once you've exhausted all avenues
at being civil, you can use ban in good conscience. You've given the player(s)
every chance to cease their actions and given them fair warning over the fact
that if they continue they risk getting banned.

58 BARENUM BARESIZE~
Syntax: mset <mob> barenum <number>
mset <mob> baresize <num>

These mob fields control the mobs ability to fight without weapons.
Barenum is the low end of the damage done and baresize is the multiplier.
For example: barenum 10 and baresize 5 would have the effect of allowing
the mob to hit barehanded for 10-50 damage. 
 
* This field also affects experience gained.
Experience is calculated as follows:
^level 3*5 + max_hit +barenum *baresize +damroll * 50
+hitroll *ch -> level *10
~

0 BASH~
Syntax:  bash
 
Bash can only be used once a fight has started.  It will inflict damage and
temporarily daze both yourself and your opponent for approximately two rounds
during which you cannot heal, flee or perform other extraneous combat actions
(i.e. you will be able to dodge/parry/attack but nothing else).  These same
consequences are inflicted on your opponent if it is a player character,
otherwise the skill only inflicts damage.
 
Note that bash has a drastically reduced chance of hitting if the basher is
not one of the primary combatants (i.e. is not tanking).

1 BERSERK~

This tactic is truly powerful, for it causes the fighter to allow pure
rage to flow through him, at the cost of his own judgement and care for
his or her well-being. While the berserked fighter will strike deeper
into an enemies' flesh, his foes will be able to take advantage and bury
their weapons deeper into the berserker.

1 'BLASTED LANDS'~
Reccommended level range: 25 - 50
 
Stretching southward from the Great Eastern Desert, lies the immense
wasteland known only as the Blasted Lands. Once a lush forest of green
filled with fierce warriors of Light, its current state lies as a warning
to the mortals of the Realms. The city of Mistaniq and the surrounding
forests were laid to waste by the actions of the their greedy ruler: the
Pharaoh Ramases. Offered eternal life in a dark pact with Vl'arescht in
exchange for the lives of his people, he became undead. Rains of flame and
acid fell from the sky, destroying the verdant countryside until nothing
was left but sand. Over the years, many foolhardy adventurers seek fortune
and power within the dark domain, but most become forever lost within its
deadly terrain. Many foul things walk the lands but it is said that the
powers of light still have a tenuous foothold here.

50 BLODKAI_COLOURS~
The flag currently appears as:
&W<&PNew Player Advisor&W>&P Bot the spiffy spiffinator spiffs spiffily here.
 
Again, this is only seen by level 25 and under, and is not seen on
NC immortals.  If you want to change the flag in the future, let
me know.
~

51 BLOODBATH~
&g
What is the BloodBath, you ask? Well, let me try to enlighten. The BloodBath
is a gathering of souls for the purpose of pleasing the Dark Gods. To let some
blood. To amuse me. How do you play, you may ask? Simple really: Qualify, pick
a partner and show up at the specified time to fight. Qualify by being online
and completing whichever mini quest is run for the purpose.
 
Eight qualifying teams will compete for the final battle approximately eight
weeks from the beginning of the BloodBath - the winning team from each round
goes to the final, eight teams per round. (Qualifying teams from each round
are exempt from participating in any further qualifiers.) If your team does
not qualify in a round, you may try again in the next round.
 
When qualifying you will be told what day and time your fight will be, usually
within the same week of qualifying, during which time you must pick a partner
and mudmail myself with their name. Your team must be ready when the fight is
called. Confused? Mudmail myself with your question. 
 
&rNO &wdisarming - Unless enough people disagree, then we'll vote.
&rNO &walternate characters: you fight with the character you qualify with.
&rNO &wsubstituting partners: if both are not present, you may fight alone.
&rNO &wdelaying fights: be ready at fight time
&rNO &wdeadlies (Sorry guys, you're too scary)

1 BLOODLET~
Syntax:  bloodlet
 
A vampire which is itself sated on blood may open his own veins to drain
a small amount of the vitae for the consumption of a more needy comrade
through the use of bloodlet. The pool spilled lasts only a very brief
time, however, as already-consumed blood loses its value quickly once
exposed again to air.
~

1 BOARD BOARDS ARCHIVES ARCHIVE~
Note boards are available throughout the Realms for you to post notes to
that deal with various topics like guild, order, council or clan
communication, announcements from the immortals, and questions for
the immortals or other people on the mud.
The Archives of Darkhaven are located in the Darkhaven Town Hall, east,
south, up and 2 south of Darkhaven Square. The Archives contain:

 - The main board of Darkhaven, for general notes and information
 - The Book of Deeds and Lore, for role-playing posts
 - The Oracle, where mortals may write private concerns, complaints,
   requests and suggestions to the high gods
 - Individual boards for different councils and organizations.

Use 'note list' to view the note posted on each board.  Type 'help note'
for detailed information on using the Realms note system.
The post office is located off western Market Street in Darkhaven, two
south, one west and one south of the city square.  Type 'help mail' for
detailed information on using the post office system.

Myra will be cutting the guilds down to 2 boards each and
getting rid of 1 other uselesss guild board.
That should put us in the range of 70 boards
~

51 BODYBAG~
&GSyntax:  bodybag <name> <show/yes/bag/now>
&GSyntax:  bodybag <name> will show the status of the corpse.

'Bodybag' gets all of <character's> corpses and puts them in
your inventory to do with as you wish.

 &g:&G Use "now" in addition to "yes" and "bag" to tell the command
   to actually bodybag the victim's corpse

 &g:&G Corpse timers run from grey to yellow to red as they approach decay

 &g:&G If the character is online and they are devoted to a deity, bodybag
   will display their deity, their favor with that deity, and how much
   favor their deity demands to supplicate corpse

You may use 'bodybag' at any time to check on a character's corpse,
but you &Ymust&G adhere to the guidelines described in 'help imm_cr1'
and 'help imm_cr2' before actually performing the corpse retrieval.

&GSee also:  &YIMMCR, TIMER, IMM_CR1, IMM_CR2
~

1 BOT BOTS BOTTING~
Bots, the running of a character using triggers while there is no one
attending it, is not illegal in itself. However, bots are held to the
same rules as playing characters. See Laws regarding "staking" and
other applicable laws. The character is accountable for any act the
bot commits.
~

1 'BP'~
This is an abbreviation for blood points.  Vampires begin with 11 bp
at creation and gain 1/1 bp for each subsequent level.
~

0 BRANDISH QUAFF RECITE ZAP STAFF WAND~
Syntax:  brandish                       (to invoke a staff)
Syntax:  quaff  <potion>                (to quaff potions)
         quaff  <potion> <container>    (quaff directly from container)
Syntax:  recite <scroll> <target>       (to recite a scroll)
Syntax:  zap    <target>                (to use a wand on a target)
  
BRANDISH invokes a magical staff. Magical staves (staffs) are items that are
held and brandished as to affect everyone in the room. Offensive spells will 
not affect players and defensive spells will not affect mobs.
 
QUAFF quaffs a POTION (as opposed to DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).
 
RECITE recites a magical scroll; the <target> is optional, depending on the
nature of the scroll.
 
ZAP fires a magical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and
you are fighting someone, then that character is used for a target.
 
You must be holding a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP.
 
All of these commands use up their objects:  Potions and scrolls have a
single charge.  Wands and staves (staffs) have multiple charges.  When a
magical object has no more charges, it will be consumed.  Use the spell
'identify' to see the remaining charges.
 
See EAT, BACKFIRE, RECHARGE, POTION, SCROLL
~

1 BROACH~
Syntax:  broach <direction>
 
This skill when used successfully enables a vampire to bypass a
locked/barred/or otherwise obstructed exit.
 
~

51 BRUJAH~
"Die with your boots on."
 
 
Here the stillness of the night shatters like glass. Here silence flees
at the first sign of intruders. Here the darkness comes to life.
From every direction rise the ecstatic screams of the Damned. Lights
flicker on and off as the shadows leap about, wildly flinging themselves
from wall to wall.
In the midst of intoxicated revelry, some sit calmly, but even their passions
struggle to run free. As the cacophony builds, even the staid feel their
non-existent pulses race.
Here all is abandon. Here anger and fury rule the dark like twin lions,
ready for the kill. Here frenzy reigns.
 
Sporadic eruptions of rage and violence constantly rend the society of
the Kindred. Find one of these eruptions and more than likely a Brujah is
there as well. This savage clan takes on anyone - prince or anarch, 
Camarilla or Sabbat, and even each other. The Brujah are infamous for their
violence and destructive frenzies; indeed, rational Cainites avoid them like
rabid dogs.
However, not all Brujah are the crazed destroyers of Kindred stereotypes.
Among Brujah can be found scholars, teachers, philosophers and leaders.
The Brujah are nothing if not contradictory, and no one Brujah truly
represents this diverse clan. For every Brujah anarch leader inciting riot
and revolution, another sits on a primogen council. 
The one constant with the Brujah is that Change is gospel; Stagnation is
anathema.
 
All the members of this Clan are rebels of one kind or another. These
malcontents tend to be fanatical in their disparate beliefs - the only
thing that unifies them is their desire to overthrow the social system,
be it Kindred or mortal. They do, however, adhere fervently to the
Masquerade, if solely for the purpose of their own survival.
~

58 BSET BSTAT~
&YSyntax&W: Bset <board filename> <field> <value>
&YSyntax&W: Bstat <board filename> (same room as board needs no args)
 
BSTAT will show the current setting for the statted board.
 
BSET will set new values for a given board.
Correct FIELD values for Bset are:
  ovnum, read, post, remove, maxpost, filename, and type
  read_group, post_group, extra_readers, and extra_removers
  All boards will be type 1, except Nerif's mail board (type 2).
Action FIELD values include:
  oremove, otake, olist, oread, ocopy, opost, and postmessg
  These should be followed by the message to be sent to those
  who are at the board, but not performing the action (similar
  to mpechoaround). Postmessg is the only message that will be
  seen by the actor of a Bset action value.

1 BUGS CODE CODER CODING DEBUG DEBUGGING DEVELOPMENT SOURCE THORIC~
&wRealms of Despair &Gis the home of the SMAUG code base.
Most of the extensive debugging and programming of SMAUG
was done by the SMAUG development team:

  Thoric, Altrag, Blodkai, Haus, Narn, Scryn, Swordbearer,
  Tricops, Gorog, Rennard, Grishnakh, Fireblade and Nivek
 
&wInterested in coding for Realms?

&GROD coders must have extensive experience with the C coding
language and preferably SMAUG coding.  If you have this type
of experience, have leveled at least one Avatar on Realms and
have the resources to code SMAUG from your home system please
send a resume to &Yblodkai@game.org&G for initial review.  If
forwarded to the Code Council, you will be asked to submit a
sample of code, general ideas for projects, and assigned a
few small test projects.  For those who are trying to obtain
some employment in the programming world, this can provide
excellent experience.

1 'BUILD' 'BUILDING'~
&GDue to the drain on personnel and abuse of privileges, we have
been forced to restrict access to our building node.  With the
public release of Smaug, the advent of Win95 versions of Smaug
such as SmaugWIZ and offline building programs such as ORB it
is still possible for aspiring builders to work on their own.
As Smaug has rapidly become one of the most popular MUD code
bases, there are an increasing number of Smaug muds seeking new
builders as well.

If you have created an area offline or elsewhere and would like
to have it run on Realms of Despair, contact &wEdmond@game.org&G
with the details.  Please be aware that Edmond is very busy,
however you will have a reply within 48 hours. Though we may not be
able to use each area we nevertheless are very appreciative of all
offers made.
 
Notes are now on the &wArea Board&G (third floor of town hall, 1
east and 1 south of the Darkhaven Square, in the northeastern
wing) to aid you in the processs of area creation.  Please read
them before approaching an immortal with building questions.
The board is read frequently and we will attempt to answer any
questions posted there as soon as possible.

1 BURROWS 'THE BURROWS'~
&GThe Shirelands are a place that are open to the various travellers who
wander into the Haon Dor forests. However, a section of that city has
survived the immigration and corruption of the Tall Races. There,
the holbytla - or, as most call them, halflings - dwell. Mostly elders who
detest the influence of Man and his ways, these hobbits are a simple folk.
This section of the Shire is called The Burrows, and it is where the old
ones make their stand.

~

0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

1 'CASTLE ZHAKRIN'~
Recommended level range: 0 - 60

Castle Zhakrin is the stronghold of the Forsaken, the home of those
who still cling to the Lost God of Evil Zhakrin. These devout followers
follow an ancient prophecy that their God will return when his name has
been sufficiently honored. To further his cause, the Forsaken bring forth
sacrifices to their God and do all in their power to further the cause
of Darkness. Castle Zhakrin's location remains shrouded in mystery, as
well as its contents and secrets.

0 CENTAUR~
Centaurs are a proud and ancient race, although most of the Realms is
ignorant of the truth of their society, legends and culture.  It is
understandable, since many centaurs are predisposed towards extremes of
either passion or violence, and the reputation of the whole race has
suffered accordingly.  Centaurs can embody cruelty, cunning, lust, and
beastliness as any of the mixed races; but their crude, animal nature
of speed and vitality is tempered with equal amounts of wisdom and
intelligence of their human side.  Thus, a complete and proud race is
formed from the two extremes.
   Centaurs prefer to remain isolated from humans and other races; the past
is not so easily forgotten and as such, most centaurs prefer to remain
within the communities to which they were born.  However, there are those
that seek adventure or have been outcast for one reason or another and
thus they must wander the Realms alone. It is these adventurous souls that
take up the way of the Warrior and chose to walk among the other races as
equals and woe unto those who stand in their way.

1 CHA CHARISMA~
Charisma (CHA in your 'score') represents your characters physical beauty
and charm.  It primarily affects:
 
 - a character's practice rate with a language scholar
 
 - prices charged to a character by shopkeepers

 - the appearance of a character to other mobiles and players.
 
No class receives charisma as a prime attribute.
 
~

1 'CHAMBER OF THE ANCIENT'~
Far off in the higher planes of the multiverse is the place known as the
Chamber of the Ancient.  Accessible only to the most powerful of deities,
this is where the dark Vl'arescht holds his throne. May Thoric bless any
unfortunate enough to be summoned here, for a fate worse than death
invariably awaits....
 
~

1 'CHANGE SEX'~
Syntax: cast 'change sex' <victim>

This spell changes the sex of the victim (temporarily).
~

51 CHANGES~
Syntax:  changes
 
Simply type 'changes' to see a listing of currently recorded changes
to the Realms itself.  Use the 'pager' or your scrollback function to
review older changes on the list, as it will usually run for some
distance into the past.
 
See also:  'news'
~

1 CHANNELS~
Syntax:  channels
Syntax:  channels +<channel|all>
Syntax:  channels -<channel|all>
 
With no options, CHANNELS show you your current channels.  With a plus or
minus sign and an option, CHANNELS turns that channel on or off.  Using the
'all' option, CHANNELS will turn on/off all normal channels.
 
Public channels are those that can be seen by everyone, regardless of their
affiliation with clans, guilds, orders or councils.  Private channels are
channels available to those with affiliations of some sort, and also tells.
 
The first channels you will have as a new player are SAY and NEWBIE.

 - to use say, the person you want to talk to must be in the same room,
   just type SAY <message>.
 - to use tell, the target person may be anywhere within the Realms, just
   type TELL <name or 0.name> [message].
 - newbiechat is seen and used only by level 1 characters, members of the
   Newbie Council, and Immortals.
 
For a more complete explanation of each channel's use and who can
use it, read section 3 of your Adventurer's Guide book.

1 'CHAPEL CATACOMBS'~
Recommended level range: 15 - 25

Beneath Darkhaven's cursed graveyard lies an ancient crypt afflicted
by the same curse. The undead run rampant in this horrible place,
rending the flesh of remaining corpses and any living who enter. Any
attempts to rid this place of evil have similarly failed. Rumors of
a more powerful undead, perhaps even a vampire, have been circulating
of late.
~

1 CHARDELETE~
Syntax:  chardelete <password> yes
 
A player may often find that the new character they have created just
isn't quite what they had wanted, and would like to recreate it from
scratch.  The 'chardelete' command permits you to destroy the
character and begin anew with the same name.
 
Note:  all equipment and money on the chardeleted character are gone
forever.  Immortals will not and cannot help retrieve such belongings
after the deed is done.
 
Only characters level 2 through 5, and 18 years of age or older, can be
chardeleted.

A chardeleted character must still be re-authorized, and there is NO
guarantee that the name with be subsequently authorized again.
 
See also:  AUTODELETE
~

1 'CHARGED BEACON'~
Syntax:  c 'charged beacon' <victim>
 
Charged beacon renders the victim susceptible to electricity attacks.
~

1 'CHARM' 'CHARM PERSON'~
The charm spell, if successful, will place the victim (only mobs, attempts
to charm other player-characters may incur the wrath of the gods) under
your control for the duration of the spell.  While under your control
the creature is your servant, and may assist you in combat and other
more minor duties.  Use the 'order' command to give them orders. As with many
other spells, charming can be difficult, and is highly dependent on the
caster's abilities. Even so, every caster will have a limit as to the number
of followers they can keep entranced.
 
Be warned, you are responsible for the actions of your charmed beast.  If
it should go awry and take the life of another player-character, you will
be charged as a murderer and will be hunted by several creatures around
the Realms.
 
Aggressive mobs will lose their aggressiveness while charmed, but will
immediately return to their violent ways when the spell wears off.  For
this reason, charmed aggressive mobs should not be taken into any area
lower than the one from which they came, and should *never* be taken
into Darkhaven or the Academy.  Those found doing so will pay dearly.
 
As a matter of etiquette, charmed mobs should not be attacked.  You can
tell a mob is charmed if it is wandering "in a dazed, zombie-like state."
Be aware when taking your charmed mobs around other characters that any
area attack such as call lightning, gas breath or earthquake will hit
your creature and cause it to engage in combat.

Checkvnums will allow you to view if any areas conflict with a set
of vnums that you need.

~

1 'CITY OF ELDESTRA' ELDESTRA HALFELFTOWN~
&CDianla speaks...
 
&c'Yes... it was a long time ago. A time when Darkhaven was a much
different place. A group of Elohai banded together in the city, for
safety. There was discrimination and violence everywhere against us,
we were seen as hybrids.
 
A great man had to be murdered before we reached the final point. We
left the city of Darkhaven and ventured into the Haon Dor Forest to
build a secluded place where all Elohai would be welcome and safe.
Past the River Nenda and across Lake Kieltron lies our fair city, where
all is serene and tranquil. Our sanctuary from the unkind world.
 
Things are better now of course, but our city still stands as the
heart of the Nation.'
~

1 'CITY OF INIQUITY' 'DROW TOWN'~
Aeons ago, dark elves emerged from the elven race that lived within the
realms' valley.  Shortly thereafter, the elves found themselves in great
distress - torn between those following a path of chaos, and those 
maintaining a life of righteousness.  A great, painful war broke out and
scattered destruction over the centuries.  Magicks of immense power flew
back and forth as each alignment fended for themselves; Many a brethren
slain.  The valley was left in turmoil, drenched in the flesh and blood of
the elven kind.
 
In the end, the good had prevailed.  The dark elves were forced from the
valley's surface and driven deep underground, where they created a new
civilization - bleak, lightless caverns and tunnels of the underworld.
After a prolonged amount of time shielding themselves from the natural
light of the world, their skin became black as night, hair silver as the
moon, and eyes red like the raging fire burning within their souls.  The
drow were born, filling their days with havoc and station within the city
in which they were forced into... The city that they had created... The
City of Iniquity.

0 CLEAR~
Syntax: clear

This command clears the screen.

See PAGELENGTH.
~

1 CLEAVE~
With a great ability to hack through underbrush and thick forest, Rangers
that have chosen the unlawful pkill path have found that they can combine their
ability with longblades and their strength to dispatch their enemies more
quickly with several devastating blows.
 
Occasionally such strong blade cleaves have been known to temporarily daze
an opponent for a very short period of time.
~

0 CLERIC CLERICS~
A cleric is a mighty healer and protector of the weak.  Led with a mission
to heal and teach, Clerics have many  varied and sundry healing spells at
their command.

While clerics possess some combat spells and magic to affect one's chances
in battle, their main goal is self preservation.  They accelerate in wisdom
and knowledge as they gain in level and experience.

The wisdom of the cleric in the ways of magic and the art of healing, make
them an extremely desirable asset for any group.
 
The following races are acceptable to the ways of the Cleric:
Human Elf Dwarf Pixie Half-Elf Gith Drow Sea-Elf Gnome
~

60 CLIMATE~
Syntax climate <field> <name>
 
This command allows you to view or modify the climate
settings for an area. There are settings for temperature,
precipitation, and wind. In addition, you may specify
neighboring areas who will affect changes in the current
areas weather. Therefore there are four fields to choose
from. Each field has a different range of values available.
 
Field name:           Values:
temp                  cold, cool, normal, warm, hot
precip                arid, dry, normal, damp, wet
wind                  still, calm, normal, breezy, windy
neighbor              <area name>
 
Specifying an area name with neighbor which is already on
the list will remove it. Using climate without any arguments
will display the area's current setting. Note that this
command always refers to the area which you are currently in.
~

1 'CLIMB'~
Syntax:  climb  <direction>
 
This skill enables you to climb into and out of rooms that require it.

~

51 COLORS~
The ability to color Help and other files is very useful. We ask
that you try to stick to these guidelines for color usage so that
we can have some consistency in their use:
 
Here are some outlines for using color on a white text file:
  &CHelp (Filename) &Wcolored cyan.
  &GLaws (Law) &WColored green.
  &PAttacker/Killer/Thief &Wcolored pink.
  &GOrder/Guild (Order/Guild) &Wcolored green.
  &RClans (Clan) &Wcolored red.
  &YSyntax &Wfor syntax references, colored yellow.
  &CDeities (Deity) &Wcolored cyan.
  &RDeadly/Deadlies &Wcolored red.
  &YConfig (+/- option) &Wcolored yellow.
 
If you wish to add other colors to your file, please use good
taste, make sure it is readable and don't get too whacky. If
you follow the above guidelines and stick to using white for
all other text, it will keep the text solid and legible. Should
you choose not to use any colors at all, that is also okay, the
above guidlines are merely for proper use of color, white is
always acceptable.
 
In addition, please keep in mind that the following topics should
not be colored except by their defaults:
  - Help (area name)
  - Help (skill)
  - Help (spell)
  - Help (class)
~

1 COLORSCHEME COLORSCHEMES~
Syntax:  colorscheme <scheme number>
Syntax:  colorscheme default
 
Colorschemes allow you to pick from a pre-configured set of color sets
for room names, room descriptions and room exits.  To restore your scheme
to the MUD's default color set, use 'colorscheme default'.  Several
schemes are similar, only swapping white with grey.  The main reason for
this is because certain popular MUD clients transpose the display of these
colors (displaying white for grey, and grey for white).
 
Current schemes are:
  &w1    &gRoomname    &ORoomdesc    &wExits
  &w2    &gRoomname    &WRoomdesc    &wExits
  &w3    &gRoomname    &wRoomdesc    &WExits
  &w4    &ORoomname    &gRoomdesc    &WExits
  &w5    &ORoomname    &WRoomdesc    &wExits
  &w6    &ORoomname    &wRoomdesc    &WExits
  &w7    &WRoomname    &gRoomdesc    &wExits
  &w8    &WRoomname    &GRoomdesc    &wExits
  &w9    &WRoomname    &ORoomdesc    &wExits

1 COMBAT~
You may choose a fight by finding a mob, and using LOOK, CONSIDER, and
IDENTIFY to gauge the difficulty of the opponent.  You can LOOK <mob>
to get a look at its equipment and description, this will often help
indicate how hard a fight might be. You can CONSIDER <mob> for a one
on one comparison of the mobs hitpoints and level to your own.  You may
also CAST IDENTIFY <mob> to get more detailed information about the mob.
 
You may start a fight by using KILL, MURDER, or many spells and skills
available to players.  The easiest way to start a fight is to KILL <mob>.
Currently, you may also MURDER <mob>, but this causes the mob to yell out.
 
You may find yourself in trouble during a fight, and wish to leave, this
can be done by using FLEE or RECALL.  You can flee a fight by typing FLEE.
You may recall from a fight with the spell 'word of recall' or by reciting
a recall scroll.  You may also set it up to flee automatically once you go
below a certain number of hitpoints by using WIMPY.  To use your wimpy, type
WIMPY or WIMPY <number of hitpoints>.  Leaving a fight with wimpy, flee, and
recall WILL cost you a loss of experience, with recall causing the greatest
loss.
 
For more information on combat, read section 12 of your Adventurer's Guide.

51 COMMENT~
Syntax: comment write
Syntax: comment subject <subject>
Syntax: comment post <player>
Syntax: comment list <player>
Syntax: comment read <player> #
 
Comment write puts you into a buffer, and the commands work just like writing
a note.  You may only read and post comments on players currently online.
 
Comments should be used for all disciplinary actions and warnings, on anyone
who makes frequent demands of or troubles for immortals in general even if
the player is not doing something specifically illegal, repeated problems,
after _all_ reimbursements, and any other information you feel would be
important to another Immortal when dealing with the player in the future.
 
If you have a disciplinary action and the player quits before you are able to
post a comment, please place a copy of the comment on the board located in
hell, room vnum 6.

0 COMPARE~
Syntax: compare <object-1> <object-2>
Syntax: compare <object>

COMPARE compares two objects in your inventory.  If both objects are weapons,
it will report the one with the better average damage.  If both objects are
armor, it will report the one with the better armor class.

COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object
you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.

COMPARE doesn't consider any special modifiers of the objects.
~

1 COMPASS~
Syntax:  compass (toggles the compass on or off)
Syntax:  compass on/off
Syntax:  config +/- compass
 
Displays a compass of visible exits on the screen as an adjunct
or alternative to the traditional autoexit display.  Different
exit types/directions/states are displayed with their direction
(NW, NW, SE, SW, N, S, E, W) when the exit is present and
visible.
 
The compass is currently in an assessment phase.  Any comments
or suggestions for alternative compass displays, tweaks to the
existing display, location in the room display, etc. should
be made via _email_ (because it's a lot easier to deal with
something drawn out like this in email rather than in short
notes and on channels) to:  blodkai@game.org
 
See also:  exits, config (look for 'autoexits')
~

-1 COMPLAINT COMPLAINTS~
Concerns and complaints may be emailed to Blodkai (blodkai@game.org).
Details are important, and logs (when not unduly log) are always best.
 
~

1 CON CONSTITUTION~
Constitution (CON in your 'score') represents your character's physical
stamina.  Among other things, it affects:
 
 - the number of hitpoints a character receives each time it levels
 
 - the number of hitpoints recovered or regenerated at each tick if
   resting or sleeping
 
 - the number of additional moves a character receives at level
 
 - improvement or worsening of a character's mental state, thus
   affecting general endurance
 
No class receives constitution as a prime attribute.
 
~

53 CONCLUSIONS~
Before moving on, let me help you draw some conclusions about the above
numbers:
 
     Example - Player A -          ArmorClass: -300
                                   Hitroll: 17
                                   Level 50 Warrior Thac0: 0
               Mobile Opponent -   ArmorClass: -300
                                   Hitroll: 17
                                   Mob Thac0: 0
 
Player A rolls his hitdie of 1 (as low as a player can roll without a critical
miss) , adds 17 to his hitdie (hitroll modifier) for a 18 (as high as a player
can roll without a critical hit). Mobs armor class is reduced to -19. The 18
total hitroll will hit, unless the mob dodges/parries the blow. Ask yourself
this question: What does an avatar need a hitroll of 100 for?
 
The exact same situation will occur on the reverse of a mob attacking a 
player. Mobs are currently being created that require the use of a dodge/parry/
evade in order to miss the blow.  This is contrary to the way the code was 
designed.  However, you must know your opponent in order to fight him.
 
So what does all this mumbo jumbo have to do with mob creation you ask? Quite
simply, everything about hitting a character or mob comes down to three 
numbers: armor class, thac0 and hitroll.
 
When creating equipment and adding 10 hitroll to the item, consider the stat 
you have just given to that player. You have eliminated 50% of the die roll a 
player would need to use in order to hit a maxed out mob, On ONE item.
 
When creating equipment and having it affect AC by -50, consider that you just 
reduced the ability of a mob to hit the player by 1/4 of its die roll. On ONE 
item.
 
When creating a mob, and by not giving it a hitroll, (normally mobs default to 
a hitroll of 2) You have given it a 3/20 chance of hitting a maxed out avatar
on its normal hits.

2 CONNECT~
Through the use of the connect command, special objects may be 'connected'
to create a totally new item. Each object is only capable of connecting to
another predetermined 'piece'. Often these 'pieces' will have little or no
similiarity to each other, apart from the fact that connecting them will
create the new item.
 
To connect two 'piece' type items together, do the following:
 
&Y  1. Type connect (obj name #1) (obj name #2)
     &wie. connect pole string
 
&Y  2. If this works, a new object will be created.
     &wie. Using the example above: a fishing pole
 
&Y  3. If the objects are not meant to connect, a message will be given which
    says 'they just don't want to fit together.'
 
&WNote: Once an item is connected, it cannot be disassembled.

0 CONTAINER CONTAINERS~
Containers are almost a necessity in the Realms.  They are used to carry
items, food, and drinks.  They help allow you to sort things, by using two
or more types of containers at once.  Corpses use many of the same commands
as regular containers.
 
EXAM <container> or LOOK IN <container> allows you to see what it contains.
 
GET <item> <container> allows you to take one item from a container.
GET ALL <container> allows you to take everything from a container at once.
GET ALL.<item> <container> allows you to take all of a particular item type
 
PUT <item> <container> puts an item inside a container.
PUT ALL <container> will put as much of your inventory in the container as
possible, until the container is full.
PUT ALL.<item> <container> will put as much of one type of item into the
container as possible, until the container is full.
EMPTY <container> will pour all of the contents onto the ground. 
EMPTY <container> <different container> will transfer the contents.
 
If you have more than one of the same container, you can type look in
2.container or get item 2.container.  For example: look in 2.portal
or get heal 2.bag.  This will also work if you have more than one corpse.
 
Read your Guide to Realms for more information on containers.
~

53 CONTAINERFLAGS~
&r----------------------------------------------------------------
 
&gThe v1 values on objects that are type container determine if
the container has an opening device and its corresponding values.
The following numbers determine its state:
 
&c                     0     No lid
                     1     Closeable
                     2     Pickproof
                     4     Closed
                     8     Locked
 
&gBy adding the numbers together you can combine their effects.
For example, setting the v1 field to 15 would make the container
openable, lockable, closed, and pickproof.

1 'CORAL DEPTHS'~
Recommended level range: 10 - 35

Following the Darkhaven River eastward, many an adventurer has come upon
a vast area of glistening water and waves.  A casual swim is enjoyed here,
though one must be wary of fish and aggressive sharks.  It is beneath the
lapping waves where the wonders, and dangers, of the Coral Depths truly lurk.
The fabled Merfolk have founded a paradise under the sea, pushing back all
manners of danger from their wondrous village.  Some of the most wise and
intelligent scholars of Despair reside in Mer Village, teaching the cherished
young.  The Merfolk have one common enemy beneath the waves: a sea hag who
resides in the deepest corner of the dark coral tunnels.  Little is known
about this hag, yet it is suspected that she is preparing one day to destroy
the Merfolk completely...

1 'CR' 'CORPSE RETRIEVAL' 'CORPSE'~
&GBefore asking an Immortal for a corpse retrieval, you must:
 
 &G1&g) &wAttempt to get your corpse yourself (be sure to use 'hide'
    invisibility, as this will get you past many mobiles which
    may be between you and your corpse)
 &G2&g) &wSeek the assistance of other players to retrieve your corpse
 &G3&g) &wIf all else fails, wait at least 20 (real world) minutes after
    your death to ask for an Immortal corpse retrieval
 &G4&g) &wIf you have devoted to a deity, you have the ability to gain
    information about your corpse using the &W'&Gremains&W'&w
    command (type &W'&Ghelp remains&W'&w), and if you have gained
    enough favor with your deity (type &W'&Ghelp favor&W'&w) you
    can &W'&Gsupplicate&W'&w to have your corpse returned (type
    &W'&Ghelp supplicate&W'&w).  Devoting is &Ystrongly&w suggested.
 
&G : &w "I need to leave now!" is not grounds for an early Immortal CR.
&G : &w Corpses decay for approximately 30 to 40 minutes (real world)
    after the time of death.
&G : &w Corpse decay will happen even while you are linkdead or after
    you quit because the Realm is an ongoing, real-time world.
&G : &w Characters listed under 'who deadly' are not eligible for any
    form of Immortal CR but may supplicate for their corpse after
    20 minutes have passed.
&G : &w Corpses &Ywill&w save over crashes and reboots, but will
    continue to decay once the Realms comes back online.  Log back on
    quickly to retrieve your corpse.
&G : &w You may pay 25 glory for a CR from a Quest Council Immortal or a
    level 54+ immortal.
&G : &w Corpses in the Realms of Worship area are not eligible for any
    form of Immortal corpse retrieval.
 
&GThe cost for a corpse retrieval is usually one item from your corpse,
unless you are using glory to buy the CR, but it is up to the discretion
of the Immortal to charge more or less.

An Immortal corpse retrieval is not a right, but a privilege.  Pestering
or being demanding is cause for the Immortal to deny your request.  An
Immortal may refuse to do any CR at their discretion.  You may not barter
which items an Immortal can take from your corpse as the charge, and the
Immortal's decision is final.

1 CRASH~
Crashes are unforeseen interruptions in the game that cause everyone
to be disconnected. If you type time and look at the system start up
time, you can determine if the game has just rebooted or if it was a
problem with only your character. 
   99.9% of the time corpses will save over a crash. The game will 
start back up with your character at the last place you saved or the
game saved you.

&W
&wAfter a four-year break from immhood, Kador has recently
&wrejoined the ranks of the Gods with a smile and an urge
&wto continue contributing to the fun and sportsmanship of
&wcountless people seeking to have a good time on Realms of
&wDespair.
&wSince becoming an active player on RoD in 1996, Kador has
&wseen many people come and go and many changes to the game.
&wAmong his least favorite of those changes, the Dwarven
&wwarrior admits he has a certain dislike for styles, but
&wbelieves the best change for Realms was the inception of
&wglory.
&wKador says he comes to the Realms to escape the daily
&wgrind of baking and cooking for a living. I managed to
&wcatch him between his new immortal role and building
&wefforts, and tie him down long enough to ask a few
&wquestions.

&O----------------------------------------------------------------
&W
&WINTRODUCTION
&W
&wExploration and mapping of  areas tends to be rather simple,
&was long as the rooms are "well-behaved." This means that
&wgoing east from room A leads to room B, and west from
&wroom B leads back to room A. It makes no difference if
&wmapping is done by hand or by using a mud client's
&wautomapper, both can handle this task without problems.
&W
&wThings start getting confusing when mazes are encountered.
&wThe rooms all look alike, causing explorers to wander for
&wmiles without reaching any destination, and getting out
&wbecomes nearly impossible.
&W
&wHence, this edition of RoD 101 will attempt to explain
&wthe various ways in which mazes can be constructed and
&wthe general strategies for getting through these sticky
&wclusters of rooms.

&W
&WTRICKS OF MAZE CONSTRUCTION 
&W
&wThis section may become get a bit technical. In order to
&wimmerse oneself completely in the atmosphere of an area,
&wit goes without saying that it is also possible to become
&whopelessly immersed and lost in mazes.
&W
&wAppreciating maze construction is different from enjoying
&wthe theme of an area. To understand a maze, it is
&wnecessary to examine a maze from a bird's eye view.

&W
&WWays That Builders Complicate Mazes
&W
&c1) Identical Room Descriptions 
&wThe standard uniform of rooms typical found in a "maze"
&wdepict room descriptions all the same. Give each room a
&wunique description and players can easily where they are
&wgoing. This is true even if the exits are one-way or do
&wnot quite link in logical ways. Give each room the same
&wdescription, and people tend to become confused and
&wdisoriented.
&W
&wNote that there are pseudo-mazes in the Realms where two-
&wway exits are completely static and line up in perfect
&wEuclidean geometry. Euclidean geometry means that only
&wone line can be drawn through a point parallel to another
&wline. However, people do get lost in these mazes, because
&wthe descriptions are all the same. Try to name a few of
&wthese types of mazes.

&O----------------------------------------------------------------
&W
&c2) One-Way Exits
&wThe next easiest way to confuse wanderers involves one-
&wway exits. Players are accustomed to a consistent grid of
&wrooms that allow walking in straight lines and back Upon
&wmoving north and finding no south exit, one's spatial
&wdirection is lost. These confusing exits may be linked
&wto another room, or even back to the same room.
&W
&c3) Shifting Exits
&wOn top of the mayhem that one-way exits may cause,
&wcertain mazes are set to shift. This means that the north
&wexit that once lead to room B is now a southeast exit
&wthat leads to room B. The north exit now leads to room C.
&wGenerally, exits only complete this merry-go-round
&wimitation just after the repop message when the area
&wresets.

&O----------------------------------------------------------------
&W
&c4) Transferring
&wTo make matters worse, sometimes it is not possible to
&wsee the intended destination because it is a "trans" room.
&wThese rooms look just like any other maze room, except
&wThat they will magically transfer you to another room if
&wyou stand about long enough.
&W
&c5) Opening and Closing Exits
&wOn occasion, room exits open and close causing confustion
&wAs to which ways one can and cannot go.
&W
&c6) Basic Maze Strategies
&wSome maze rooms that are nodrop and/or nomagic. They
&wprevent easy mapping of the maze with simple marking
&wtechniques, and norecall rooms create panic when people
&wgive up solving the maze.  They player wants to get out
&wthe "easy way," but cannot.

&W
&YLittle Secret: &wAt the present moment, there are no
&wdynamically generated mazes in Smaug. In simpler terms,
&wthe code (the computer) does -not- make mazes, human
&wbuilders do. Builders may program the computer to help
&wcomplicate matters a bit, but mazes are made by people.
&W
&wThis very significant fact means that all mazes are quite
&wfinite. A computer may string 10,000 rooms together
&wwithout qualms, but a human would have a headache after a
&wfew hundred. As long as the builders intend for there to
&wbe a start and an end to the maze, explorers may find
&wthem. It may take persistence, but it -is- possible.

&W
&WBASIC STRATEGIES TO SOLVE MAZES
&W
&wAt least 90-95% of the mazes in the Realms of Despair are
&wsolvable with two basic strategies. If it is a big maze,
&wit may take patience, persistence and determination.
&W
&c1) Track
&wIf a trackable mob or player is available beyond the maze,
&wtrack will normally create a path straight to the target.
&wOnly in complicated mazes that are constructed
&wdifferently will this not help.
&W
&c2) Room Markings + SCRY
&wThese two concepts are the basic foundation of nearly all
&wmaze solution techniques. The idea is to place different
&w"entities" in each room. This allows for recognition that
&wthe explorer has visited a room and can tell the
&windividual rooms apart.

&wThe most commonly used ways of marking rooms:
&W- &wdrop coins
&W- &wcreate and drop balls of light/food
&W- &wcreate fire/spring
&W- &wdrop other items 
&W- &wetc.
&W
&wThe scry spell is the easiest way to determine which
&wrooms are linked to the one an explorer is currently
&wstanding in. Variations on this include scan and actually
&wwalking into the next room to see.

&WMAZE MAPPING TECHNIQUES
&W
&Y+ Minimum Effort
&W
&wWhen not planning to walk through the maze more than
&wonce and others (grouped players) do not need to follow
&wthe trail, the quickest way to get to point B is the mark
&wand scry method.
&W
&wDrop a mark in the first room and scry for the intended
&wdestination. If it is not there, step into an unmarked
&wroom, mark it (i.e., drop a coin), and scry for the
&wdestination again. Continue to mark rooms and scry until
&wthe destination is finally located.

&gMapping &w- &Gby Juliana                                     &cRoD 101
&O----------------------------------------------------------------
&W
&wTime spent in marking is minimal. However, this method
&wleaves the maze in a bit of a mess for the next person
&wwalking into it. Always check all directions in a room
&wbefore leaving it, or the desired exit may have been
&wmissed. Attempting to relocate the start point will be
&wdifficult with the rooms already marked.
&w
&Y+ Moderate Effort
&W
&wWhen planning to return through a maze various times
&wbefore a reboot, it makes sense to lay a trail that may
&wbe followed repeatedly.
&W
&wBasically, mark the rooms as described above, but give
&weach room visited a different number of markings or
&wunique markings. When the end of the maze is reached,
&wexplorers may  simply follow the marks 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.

&O----------------------------------------------------------------
&W
&wFor even more efficiency, return to the start of the maze
&wand scry for marked rooms. It might be that the quickest
&wpath is actually 1, 4, 6 instead.
&W
&Y+ Maximum Effort
&W
&wThis method is only for those explorers that must
&widentify every minor detail of a particular maze, have
&wplenty of time to kill and have plenty of paper on which
&wto record findings.
&W
&wSimply put, the most that can be done to map a specific
&wmaze is to mark every room uniquely. Scry in every room,
&wto determine which rooms the exits connect to.

&O----------------------------------------------------------------
&W
&wTake a piece of paper, and draw many little squares in
&wrows and columns. Leave enough space in between the
&wsquares to draw exit lines. Graphing paper may aid in
&wthis process.
&W
&wStep into the first room of the maze. Mark it as room 1
&won the paper and mark the all of the exits leading out of
&wthe room.
&W
&wPick an exit at random and mark the next room as 2.
&wContinue scrying and marking rooms until there are
&wabsolutely no rooms left and all exits link somewhere.
&W
&wThis kind of maze blueprint is much simpler to make if the
&wexits do not shift. If they do, try to complete the
&wprocess within one shifting interval. Otherwise, the
&wmapping becomes more confusing.

&BDear Little Lost Sheep,
&wMy first reminder is that this is a game. However, it is
&wa game with its own little society. People me and go from
&wthis society through somewhat of a revolving door
&wsituation.  Make the best of the new people you meet and
&wset a new example with those you have already encountered.
&wLive and learn.  Forgive and forget.

&BDear Little Lost Sheep,
&wWhat others think of us is in essence unimportant. The
&wimportance arrives when we ourselves place too much
&wrelevance in these views. Instead of attatching such
&wreverence to what others think, regulate your own
&wbehavior.
&wIf you behave in a manner that seems reasonable and
&wconsiderate, others should respond favourably towards
&wyou.
&wIf they do not, dismiss them as worthless. Although...
&wit is always possible you have no judgement or concept of
&wwhat people find offensive. Enjoy!

&WBattle of the Sexiest
&W
&BDear Myra and Ilsensine,
&w My buddies and I have a bet going and we need your help.
&w You see, my friend here says that Iliana is the sexiest
&w imm.  However, I think that Tiki is.
&w What do you guys say?
&c-Curious Chap
&W
&BDear Curious Chap,
&wI have to say that sexiness is purely in the eye of the
&wbeholder.  Now, given that I adore both, you have to
&wrealize that one is a sexy pirate and the other is an
&wcute little pixie.  So, if you are in a snuggle mood,
&wkiss on Tiki.  If you are in a playful and naughty mood,
&wtake a walk down the plank with Ili.

&wHahaha. This one is easy. Ili is the sexiest. The two
&wdeciding factors are as follows.
&W
&w1) Iliana is an 'Il...' and we are all hot.
&w2) Tiki is my sister, and a foul seeeeeeester at that!

1 CRYSTALMIR~
Recommended level range: 25 50


In a quiet valley somewhere south of Solace lies a crystal lake surrounded
by a ring of mountains. The locals call this lake "Crystalmir", and legend
has it that a large dragon like turtle dwells deep beneath it's waters. The
valley is rumoured to be inhabited by small bands of hobgoblins and a few
farmers who attempt to grow crops there. In the mountains where the wild
horse roams, some say there lies a secret passage into the vast forest of
mazes.

First thing is to print out the checklist that will be listed below. It will
make your life and the mortals lives a lot easier and will make this go much
smoother. Unlike the usual pkill arena, this is a bit complicated and will
require an amount of work for the imm running the quest. 
 
&RO&W Pick your teams, numbers don't matter, no more than 4 teams. Teams can 
  be as big as you'd like.
&RO&W Trans all team members to 31700.
&RO&W At 31700 each player can 'look rules' to make sure they are acquainted
  with the game.
&RO&W Determine the number of teams to be played, and then tell the guardian
  that number. eg. tell guardian 3 teams will set up the arena for three   
  teams.
&RO&W Assign each team a color (red, blue, green, yellow) and a direction to   
  go out of where you just trans'd them to. Remember where they went and   
  refer to the numbers in the diagram in room 31788 for the room numbers.
&RO&W Goto 31788 - The Control Room
&RO&W Assign each color their appropriate mob. by saying the color and then
  the room number to which they are assigned. eg. 'say blue 1' assigns the   
  blue mob to room 1 (vnum 31726)
 
&G(Continued on help ctf2)
~

52 CTF2~
&RO&W Goto each room that a team has been assigned to. You need to issue out 
  sashes to each player. tell the mobs to 'load sash' and they will drop the   
  appropriately colored sash in that room for that teams members to carry.
  ** NOTE : Players cannot leave their stronghold without a sash **
&RO&W Once enough sashes have been handed out at each teams strongholds,   
  Goto 31700 to begin the games
&RO&W At 31700 say 'begin the match' The guardian will unlock and open the 
  strongholds to begin the game.
&RO&W To open the bleachers, you can now say 'open the bleachers' and a mob
  will be placed one north of X-roads, looking at this mob causes him to 
  whisper to you the phrase needed to be transed to the bleachers
&RO&W When a player dies, before giving him his corpse back, ensure that you 
  check his corpse for a guidon. If he was carrying one, remove the guidon 
  from that players corpse and you can either give it to the person who 
  killed him or drop it at the place of death. Whichever you like.
&RO&W After death, a player should be trans'd to room 31794 and be given his 
  corpse there. The room programs will ensure he does not leave with arena
  items in his inventory. Do NOT trans people out with arena items on them.
&RO&W If a player turns in an opposing teams guidon to his own mob 
  representative, the mob will announce the team that has been eliminated.
 
&G(continued on help ctf3)
~

52 CTF3~
&W  the mob will announce the team that has been eliminated. Manually trans 
  that teams members out at this point.
&RO&W If a player sacrifices a guidon, he will be trans'd to 'The Hole'. A
  special place for the idiots.  Please do not remove people from this room,  
  they will be trans'd out on a 40% random chance.
&RO&W Players not carrying a sash in the maze will also eventually be
  trans'd out if the maze by room progs. They will be trans'd to 31794,   
  which is the way out of the maze.
&RO&W After the game is complete(last team standing, or only one to maintain 
  control of their guidon), all remaining players should be trans'd to 31794 
  for turning in arena equipment.
&RO&W After all persons have left the arena, goto 31700 and 'say finished'.
  This will lock all the strongholds and move the mobs back to 31788 as well 
  as purge the strongholds.
 
&W Any questions can be answered by Edmond regarding the operation of the arena.

1 'CURSED LANDS'~
Recommended level range: 25 - 50

Long ago, the Clan Tree once flourished. As the Clan Tree prospered, so did
the beautiful land of Cridhe. Then Raphos the Usurper came and used the
Clan Tree for his own evil purposes. The Gods deemed this to be wrong and
cursed the land and its peoples. A dark shadow fell over the land, plunging
it into eternal winter. Then began the Parting, where the elves seperated
themselves from the land, it is rumored that they left behind the haven
of Loch Prith, which contains many wonders, and the Gwlyfan of legend are
said to remain there as well. Cridhe, once a beautiful paradise, is now an
icy wasteland, split in half by the frozen river of Sobus. Two towns remain,
fighting a losing battle against the curse. Inys Haen to the north. suffers
the depradations of Nohrish raiders from Inys Nohr, dark stronghold of the
Felonarch, Nazir. Nazir, a descendant of Raphos, bears the mark of the curse
and is said to hold the last surviving piece of the Clan Tree. Between the two
lands lie the moors known as the Sticks and the Far Clans who remain ever
apart from the two towns.

0 DAMAGE~
When one character attacks another, the severity of the damage is shown
in the verb used in the damage message.  Damage messages vary depending
on weapon type, or what is inflicting the damage.  Escalating damage is
indicated by the use of _ _ around the messages, regardless of weapon
type.  Messages in all caps indicate even higher degrees of damage,
while those surrounded by * * indicate the highest levels.
 
The message shown will reflect the actual damage you are inflicting on
(or receiving from) your opponent, and not a specific fixed amount.
~

54 DAMPLUS~
.
For those unsure of what damplus is, it is part of the damage
equasion for a mob... ie:  10d6 + 10   (the +10 is the damplus)
This "damplus" is always added, whether or not the mob is barehanded or
wielding a weapon.   This is basically the mob's damroll.
 
~

1 DAMROLL~

1 DARKHAVEN~
Recommended level range: 0 - 60


Darkhaven, famed City of Hope, lies in the center of the Realm's main
continent. The city, though constantly under the threat of invasion, has
never fallen to the forces of Darkness and remains one of Light's most
fervent defenders. In fact, the greatest adventurers of Despair originate
from Darkhaven, probably due to the excellent teachings of the famed
Darkhaven Academy. Darkhaven is a growing city, with busy markets filled
with objects of wonder and anyone wishing to join one of Despair's nine
guilds will certainly want to visit Darkhaven, where the guild halls are
located. Also of note is the newly revamped Art Gallery and Town Hall.
~

1 'DARKHAVEN ACADEMY'~
Recommended level range: 1 - 5

The Darkhaven Academy is the training institute of majestic Darkhaven.
A great number of adventurers come here to learn the basics of battle and
spellcasting, as well as many survival techniques. Magically controlled
by Avatars of the most powerful deities, there is an abundance of monsters
here kept for the sole purpose of practice and tutelage.
~

1 'DARKHAVEN ART GALLERY'~
Recommended level range: 10 - 50

The strange, magical artwork of Darkhaven's artisans is represented
here. Beautiful paintings and strange sculptures abound in this
strange building, which was wrought of stone by the dwarves. It is
rumored that there is more to the artwork than meets the eye. Some
even say that you may enter the paintings as if they were portals to
distant places...

1 DEADLY~
A "Deadly" character is one who shows up under the Deadly Characters portion
of the Who list (type 'who deadly' to see a list deadly characters online).
Your character will be deadly if you choose the path of the pkillers when
you first entered the Realms.  You are not officially a Deadly character
until your name shows up on 'who deadly'. You may also become deadly by
asking a God to set you to pkill or by joining a deadly clan.
 
See "laws pkill" for guidelines regarding deadly play.
 
** Only -- only -- deadly characters may attack other characters, and only
   deadly characters may be attacked by other deadlies.
*** Until your character shows up on the Deadly portion of the who list,
    you may not yet engage in pkill activities.
**** Once you are a deadly player, you may never return to the peaceful way
     of life. Deadly is forever.
~

1 DEADLYCLANS~
Clans are a society within Realms composed of a group of players which
have joined together under a common cause. If you are a member of a
clan you have the ability to pkill other deadly players outside of your
own clan. Depending on the clan you join, you may be asked
to follow a set of rules dictated by the clan's leaders.

For more information on a current deadly clan type HELP <clanname>
 
NOTE: Non-deadly and deadly players may join a deadly clan, however
when the character is outcasted it remains deadly.
~

1 DEADLYHQ~
Peacefuls are not permitted EVER to enter deadly headquarters.
&YIf you should find yourself in one, whether by error or teleport,
it is advisable to leave as soon as possible or you can be escorted
out by an immortal.
~

0 DEATH~
When your character dies, you are reincarnated at the Altar to Thoric in
Darkhaven (or your clan's temple).  Your corpse is left behind where you
were killed, together with all of your equipment.  Your gold stays with
you (the gods want you to have your gold).
 
Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death, and you lose
experience points as well.  Following/groups are not affected by death.
 
Corpses decay after time.  When this happens the objects inside a corpse
will decay with it.  Player corpses last roughly 30 minutes of real time.
Only the player who died or someone in their group can retrieve objects
from a player's corpse.  The only exceptions are for deadly characters,
who can loot each other's corpses at will.
 
If you have chosen a deity and have gained enough favor, you may be able
to supplicate to your god for your corpse.  Also see 'help supplicate',
'help deities', 'help favor' for more information on deities.
 
For more information on death, see section 13 of your Adventurers Guide.
 
~

1 DEATHTRAP DT~
A "death trap" refers to a scenario where one moves into a "room" and is
immediately awakened from death with no equipment or corpse. A corpse
recovery is not an option in this case as there is no corpse to retrieve.
 
There are also pseudo death traps that may appear to be a dt, but leave a 
corpse or transfer a corpse to another area. This is not a true dt. 
 
It is often advisable to look before one leaps and heed room descriptions.
DT's do not warrant a reimbursement, they are a part of the game. Gold, 
glory and favor are not affected by a death trap.
~

57 DECK~
&WTo properly administer your involvement in any Deck of Many Things
situation, please follow these instructions:
 
&c1) Get and examine the player's card. If they have no card, then they
    cannot play.
&O2) Ostat deckmarker (there will be only one in the game at any time).
    The short description on this object will point to the person who drew
    drew the card from the deck. They are the only person who is allowed
    to play. No alts allowed in this game.
&c3) Make certain the player is in room 1616. It is highly unlikely that they
    will be anywhere else, but best to be certain. You may allow them to play
    from this room, but you must remove the NOMAGIC flag before starting.
&O4) Clear the room of any mortals, or transfer the player to any immortal
    room. Please be certain that the room is not flagged NODROP, as that
    could wind up causing you alot of trouble. NOFLOOR is similarly bad.
    Also be sure there are no items on the floor before you begin, as they
    could easily dissappear at the draw of a card.
&c5) Drop and sac the card. The Deck will load and echo instructions to the
    rooom intended for the player.
&O6) Be certain the player is dressed and has a fair amount of gold. No risk
    to the player defeats the purpose of this deck.
&c7) When the player pulls from the deck, instructions will be echoed around
    them for you to carry out. Many times, these instructions will not ask
    for your assistance at all. Sometimes they will.
&O8) Once you have finished with the player, be certain that they carry no
    cards, that they have picked up anything they have won, and the room
    is free of the deck and deckdaemon. Player may then be transed back
     to the deckmarker, or one room away if such a location is too unsafe.
 
&YImmortal Power: Any player who attempts to flee his fate after drawing the
card in your prescence is to be loaded up and given the highest possible
penalty allowed by the card. Helling them for a day would also be advised.
 
&CIf the player is given the right to redraw, you will see that the deck is
still in the room. You must first perform what the card asks of you, then
invoke Mob #1700. You may then allow the player to say "I am ready" once again.
~

1 'DECK OF MANY THINGS'~
There are a lot of rumors that abound about the Deck of Many Things. Some say
it is a device left over from the war against the darkness, others will argue
that it is a toy of the Gods and as such, a temperamental entity. One thing
is for certain, the Deck of Many Things, when encountered, should not be
attempted unless one is stout of heart. It is a magical device that speaks in
riddles and at times, speaks very clearly to the Gods of its wishes, leaving
the victim in the dark. Beware the Deck of Many Things - It can bring you to
great riches or plunge you into eternal blackness; The Gods are bound to
follow the ruling of the Deck, and the Deck accepts only those who possess
the courage to face it.
 
&YNOTE: If you are not fully equipped the immortal residing over the pull
has every right to deny you your chance.  This is a game of risk and must
be played as such.

This style emphasizes the deflecting of blows from an enemy. It is similar
to the evasive style, except that it focuses on holding ground instead of
dodging. An effective fighter will take less damage from an enemy, but not
as much as one using evasive tactics. A fighter will also do less damage to
enemies, but slightly greater than those who simply evade.

command or wait for the character to autodelete.  Autodelete times are listed
below:

     Level 2 characters not played in one week will autodelete.
     Level 3 characters inactive for 2 weeks will delete.
     Level 4 characters inactive for 3 weeks will delete.
     Level 5 and up characters will delete between 60 and 90 days.

If your character deletes due to inactivity, there is no way to recover it.

the player file offline.

DISCONNECT <character> immediately disconnects that character.

FREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any
commands at all.

hospitality.  A wall painting illustrates the history of The Symposium in
great detail.  It is here that anyone needing to speak with the Leader of
the Symposium is welcome to relax.  The council's secretary is often seen
here, buried beneath piles of parchments in an unending effort to perform
all of her duties for this very busy group.  The chamberlain, who works
here on a volunteer basis, is often distracted.  Enjoy your visit, and

1 DEX DEXTERITY~
Dexterity (DEX in your 'score') represents your character's agility, and
it affects (among other things):
 
 - the maximum number of items you can carry at once in your inventory;
   with each additional point of dex you can carry additional items.
 
 - each additional point of dexterity also lowers (improves) your natural
   armor class.
 
 - the number of new moves you receive each time you level, as well as the
   number of moves you regenerate at each tick (when resting to refresh or
   regain movement points).
 
 - success chances with bash, stun and gouge, and helps determine whether a
   thief will be able to poison a weapon or tumble effectively.
 
Dexterity is also very important for quaffing potions in combat.  High dex
will allow you to quaff without dropping many potions during the heat of
battle, while a poor dexterity will cause you to accidentally drop many
of the valuable vials.
 
Dexterity is the prime attribute of thieves and vampires.

54 DICE~
&GSyntax: &cmset mob hitnumdie <value>
        mset mob hitsizedie <value>
        mset mob hitplus <value>
&Gand ...
        &cmset mob damnumdie <value>
        mset mob damsizedie <value>
        mset mob damplus <value>
 
&GMobs are created when the mud is rebooted and areas are first loaded.
They can also be created after being killed or purged and an area resets.
 
When a mob is created, the number of hit points is a random number
within a range. The minimum is (hitnumdie + hitplus). The maximum
is (hitnumdie * hitsizedie) + hitplus.

Some examples:
 
&Whitplus     hitnumdie   hitsizedie    mob's hp range
     &c200        10         20          210 - 400
     50         1          1           51 -  51
     10         2          3           12 -  16
 
&GThere are two little quirks that are important. First - if hitnumdie
or hitsizedie are zero - then the mob's hp are set to some random
number. So if you want to control the mob's hp, make sure you set
hitnumdie and hitsizedie to at least 1. Second - in order for the
dice values to take effect, you must purget the mob and invoke a
new one.
 
Damage dice work the same as hit dice and control the amount of
damage an unarmed mob does in a single hit. You can increase this
damage by setting "numattacks" from 2 to 20.
 
You should know that we are uncertain of exactly how the mob's
"damroll" is used. Some people think that if a mob has a weapon, then
the damage dice aren't used and the weapon's damage stats take over.
There are some mobs that hit much harder when disarmed and this supports
that assumption.&w
~

56 DICEFORMULAS~

1 DICING GAMBLING TRADING~
Gambling or trading for equipment or characters is a mortal issue. Under
no circumstances will an immortal get involved in these issues.  If you
participate in any of the above, you do so realizing the risk and 
understanding that should you be cheated in any way, you may not call upon
an immortal to get involved.
 
~

54 'DIEROLL SETTINGS'~
Syntax: dieroll <number of die to roll>
 
Any item of chance can be made "rollable".  The following settings determine
what is "rolled".
 
v0 - The number of sides on each "die"
v1 (0/1) - Whether to use the numeric values of each side or preset "text
     descriptions" for each face.  In order to set text descriptions for each
     face, set the die non-proto and add an "ed" for each side.  Regardless of
     what the ed is called, it will use them in order they appear in the list.
     NOTE:  The ed's HAVE to be "Secondary" in order for it to work.
v2 (0/1) - Whether to use each side of the die only once on any particular
           roll.
v3 (0/1) - Whether to limit the number of rolls to the number of sides on the
           die.

1 DIG DIGGING BURY BURYING~
Syntax:  dig
Syntax:  dig  <direction>
Syntax:  bury <item>
 
You can dig and bury items through the use of the dig skill and bury command.
Buried items are not visible to players, even through the use of spells such
as locate object.  To dig an item up, type dig with no arguments.  Having a
shovel raises your chance of success.  If you dig in a direction, you will
attempt to dig open an exit.
 
To bury an item (or corpse), drop the item on the ground and bury <item>.
Depending on the size and weight of the object, you might need a shovel.
 
* Note:  Deadly players can bury/dig up each other's corpses. *
 
Items buried will not last beyond crash or reboot.  Do not attempt to use
this skill for storage of items you wish to keep.

                   in the process.

         And: Mads Haar and Stephan Dahl for additional locations.

  The Original DIKUMud was Developed at the Department of Computer Science
                     at the University of Copenhagen.

1 DISARM~
Syntax:  disarm
 
Disarm is an auxiliary fighting command to attempt to disarm your opponent.
Several things affect your ability to disarm or resist a disarm attempt
successfully, including your weapon and your stats compared to the weapon
and stats of your opponent.
 
You can only attempt to disarm your primary opponent, meaning you will be
unable to try to disarm a second or third attacker until you have disposed
of the first.

(&W1&G)  &Wyou are willing to abide by the decisions of the Immortals
     concerning all issues involved in the game, and&G
(&W2&G)  &Wconversation and situations may arise during the course of
     play that may not be suitable for young children.

&GBy these acknowledgments you hereby save and except the Realms of
Despair and its Administrators from any and all liability that may
arise during gameplay.

You also agree that failure to abide by Immortal decisions may
result in the complete termination of your playing privileges.

~

1 DISCLOSURE~
Syntax c 'disclosure'
 
This spell will reveal any sneaking or hiding players in the area. However,
it will also reveal the caster.
~

1 DISMISS~
Syntax: dismiss <target>

The dismiss command will force your charmed mobile to follow itself and
will negate the charm effect.
 
~

0 'DISPEL EVIL'~
Syntax: cast 'dispel evil' <victim>
 
This spell invokes the wrath of the gods upon an evil victim.  If you do
not specify a target, the spell's effect will strike you instead of a
secondary target.
~

0 'DISPEL MAGIC'~
Syntax:  cast 'dispel magic' <character>
 
This spell dispels magical affects on the victim.  It may be used as an
offensive spell to remove an enemy's magical advantages, or as a benign
spell to completely remove your own magical affects.
 
'Dispel magic' can be used by players and mobiles alike against either
players or mobiles.  It cannot remove affects from equipment, your race
or your deity; some other affects are immune to this spell as well.
 
When a caster successfully casts 'dispel magic' on themself they will
remove all of their dispellable magical affects.  If a mage successfully
dispels a victim, the number of affects stripped will depend on their
success and intelligence.  Otherwise a successful cast of 'dispel magic'
on a victim will result in the removal of a single affect each time
(victims will notice when and what affects are stripped).
 
WARNING:  this is an offensive spell, and its use on anyone other than
yourself will be treated as an attack on your target.
 
~

1 DISRUPTION~
With the spell 'Disruption,' the casting Mage causes his opponent to
be enveloped in a weird energy field that momentarily alters the plane
which the victim inhabits.  The spell was an early attempt by the Dark
Mage Thanatos to cause teleportation, but it was a failed attempt.  
Instead of teleporting it causes a horrendous nerve-wracking pain as
the victim exits and reenters his current plane of existence.

1 'DRAGON CULT'~
Recommended level range: 5 - 25

The Cult of the Dragon worships the apocalypse and death. A highly

As the ages pass, the Order of Dragonslayer continues its eternal
struggle against the dragons of Despair. The weaker members of the
draconian race slowly began to die out and were forced to retreat. The
draconians, a breed of half-dragon humanoids, were led by their king
into the Shadow Grove. Within this shadowy land, they erected a towering
structure with the aid of many powerful dragons of all colors. The
most powerful of these, the Dragon Queen Tiamat, was later magically
banished to the Dragon Tower by the most powerful Dragonslayer mages.

1 'DRAGONSLAYER HQ'~
Recommended level range: 0 - 60

The Order of Dragonslayers has been an influential group for time
immemorial. Composed of fierce fighters and wise sages, they have
sought out and destroyed dragons for centuries in an attempt to 
destroy the reptilian race. Little is known about the Castle of 
Dragonslayers for if the dragons ever discovered it, the Order would
be in grave danger.

1 DRIA~
&W=============================================================================
&wNow the flames they followed Joan of Arc
as she came riding through the dark;
no moon to keep her armour bright, 
no man to get her through this very smoky night. 
She said, "I'm tired of the war,
I want the kind of work I had before,
a wedding dress or something &Wwhite&w
to wear upon my swollen appetite."

Well, I'm glad to hear you talk this way, 
you know I've watched you riding every day 
and something in me yearns to win 
such a cold and lonesome heroine. 
"And who are you?" she sternly spoke 
to the one beneath the smoke. 
"Why, I'm &rfire&w," he replied, 
"And I love your solitude, I love your pride." 
 
"Then &rfire&w, make your body cold, 
I'm going to give you mine to hold," 
saying this she climbed inside 
to be his one, to be his only bride. 
And deep into his &rfiery&w heart 
he took the dust of Joan of Arc, 
and high above the wedding guests 
he hung the ashes of her wedding dress. 
 
It was deep into his &rfiery&w heart 
he took the dust of Joan of Arc, 
and then she clearly understood 
if he was &rfire&w, oh then she must be wood. 
I saw her wince, I saw her cry, 
I saw the glory in her eye. 
Myself I long for love and light, 
but must it come so cruel, and oh so bright?

1 'DROW CITY'~
Recommended level ranges: 15 - 25

Early in Despair's history the elves were all one race, on the side of
good. But Laschte, in his infinite insanity enticed a group of elves
from the village of Misinkii, turning them on the path of darkness and
destruction. He warped them to be haters of light, cruel and warlike,
even upon each other. He then sent one of his children, a demi-goddess
of chaos and arachnids to watch over them and prepare them as fodder
in his war with Brontrel. Llolth took these dark elves into her evil web
of deception and had them build a city beneath the dwarven forest. Four
houses arose amidst the strife and chaos between the drow as they
now are called. Llolth's priestesses rule over the city preparing them
for the day they will have vengeance on the surface elves.  Lately, 
rumors have sprung up about an alliance between Drow City and Shadowport..
 
~

-1 DROW DROWELVES~
Drow are the darker, more evil cousins of Elves.  They were once part of
the happier community of Elves which roam the forests today, but have
long since moved under the ground, building vast subterranean cities and
complex networks of caves.

Drow have dark skin and light hair, and are moderately weaker and have
a more slight constitution than average humans.  Still, like all Elves,
they have a slightly higher dexterity than men.

Members of this race specialize in spell casting, and have thus developed
a very high intelligence.  Being creatures of darkness the Drow tend to
fight more proficiently in the darkness, and have &Ginnate infravision&w
with which to discern objects and living things in the absence of light.
They also possess inherent &Gscry&w, and are &Gresistant to poison.&w
 
Drow's can follow the ways of the following classes:
Mage Cleric Thief Vampire Augurer Nephandi

Drow gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 1.08.  The subterranean
drow city lies somewhere beyond the northern plains.

~

0 DRUID DRUIDS~
The druid is a lover and protector of the natural land.  Be it the forests
full of centaurs and deer, the streams full of fish, or the bug-infested
swamps, a druid always seeks to protect and preserve nature.  Wielding
mighty spells from the gods themselves, druids strive hard at their work.
 
Strong in wisdom, with a body trained to near perfection by their rugged
lifestyle, a druid has many disciplines upon which to draw.  From powerful
spells of healing which can bring the near dead back to full vigor, to the
ability to mystically create water and food, to the awesome power of nature
which they command in battle via spells able to quake the land and split
the sky, druids demonstrate that mastery of magic is not just a hobby, but
a way of life for them.  Able to face many warriors on almost even footing,
and able to shield themselves nearly as well as some mages, druids are
truly a gifted class.
 
The following races are acceptable to the ways of the Druid:
Human Elf Dwarf Pixie Half-Elf Sea-Elf Gnome
~

1 'DUAL WIELD'~
Characters with this skill are able to wield two weapons at once. To
do so, the character must remove any 'held' item and any shield, then
simply wield two weapons. Characters with strength under 25 may be
unable to dual wield two very heavy weapons.
 
Once two weapons are wielded, the affects of the skill are automatic.
~

52 'DUEL CHECKLIST'~
&Wo &GGet the names of all of the participants and go to room 41. Have each
  fighter send you a tell when ready. This prevents folks from being
  "volunteered" for pkills they know nothing about.
 
&Wo &G Once everyone participating is in the room, have them state the rules for
  the pkill, such as disarm, looting, spells allowed, etc. Make sure it is
  clear that you are there to trans people in and out and get corpses, not
  settle disputes or 'referee' in most cases.
 
&Wo &G Collect 1,000,000 coins from each participant. This cost can be waived based
  on the size of the group and the purpose of the pkill. Organizations pkilling
  as a group will typically have the fee waived.
 
&Wo &G Tell one group / participant go up, and the other down, and to begin when
  they are ready and spelled up. (Room 41 is no-magic)
 
&Wo &G Watch the Monitor channel, and as each participant dies, trans and bodybag
  <victim> now/yes" each one. When all have died, trans the winner.
 
&Wo &G Give 500,000 coins to the winner. Make sure everyone checks for missing or
  disarmed weapons as they loot their corpses, and retrieve them as needed.
 
&Wo &G Ensure all victims have had their <ATTACKER> flags pardoned, and all corpses
  are completely empty.
 
&Wo &G Drop the rest of your gold to put you back below the 50k limit and sac it.
  Make sure all the corpses are empty, then re-bodybag and eat the corpses to
  clean up, or have someone purge the room.  (If the corpses are not removed
  from the room, it leaves the players unable to supplicate their corpses until
  a reboot deletes them, as the supplicate program would first find the corpse
  in room 41, and finding it unretrievable,   would fail.)
~

1 DUEL DUELS DUELING~
Duels between Deadly Characters:
 a) any level deadly may duel any deadly within their 5 level pkill range
 b) combat must be overseen by an Acolyte (level 52) or higher immortal
 c) looting is permitted if agreed upon prior to combat
 d) if clanned characters are involved in combat, the respective clan deity
    or deities cannot oversee the duel
 
Duels between Peaceful Characters
 a) Players must be within 5 levels of each other to duel.
 b) combat must be overseen by an Acolyte (level 52) or higher immortal
 c) a one-item loot limit is imposed; parties can agree to no loot at all
 
Any additional stipulations for individual duels beyond those listed here
must be agreed upon by both combatants and the overseeing immortal _prior_
to combat.  (fleeing, disarming, quaff limits, etc.)  Anything within the
duel not stated as illegal will be considered legal.
 
* Note that no immortal is ever required to oversee a duel.
  There is a 1000000 gold fee per combatant, however the winner receives
  one half of their money back.
~

0 DUNHILL 'DUNHILL DEMESNES' 'DUNHILL DEMESNE'~
Recommended level range:  10 - 40
 
During the Time of Legends, when the forces of Light and Darkness fought
for domination of the Realms, there arose a powerful force for Good; The
Lords of Light.  These Lords of Light travelled the Realms, combatting
evil where they found it and driving it out until they could fight no
more.  Once the battles were over, the Elves offered the Lords of Light
a place to live among the trees, but they declined the offer and bade the
Elves farewell, and were granted safe passage through Elvish territory to
the lands beyond the valley. Once past the Elven forests, they constructed
a bastion of Good upon the great grassy plains they found and all was well.
Then, the gods of Darkness caused a great black rain to fall upon them, and
an evil plague decimated the populace.  The Lords of Light were forced into
themselves, away from the world, biding their time until they could return
and rebuild their ranks. Now they search for those who would pass the tests
put to them and join the Lords of Light to fight against evil!
~

1 DUPE DUPING DUPLICATING~
Duplicating, or duping as it is more commonly known, is not only
wrong, but illegal.  It involves the process by which an item or
object duplicates itself during a crash or reboot.  In most cases
it is unintentional, but in very few, extreme cases, it is purposeful.
If you experience duping as an accident, report it to an Immortal
IMMEDIATELY!  If you are caught duping as a means of reproducing
equipment, you will be severely punished.
~

0 DWARF DWARVES DWARFS~
The dwarven race was the fourth of the Realms, fashioned from earth and
stone by the gods and melded by fire.  They are long-lived, fiercely
loyal, and are known equally for their hardiness and cantankerous
personalities.  Dwarves are miners by tradition, working with and
building within the dirt of the earth and stone of the mountains.

Dwarves are shorter than humans and elves, averaging from four and a
half to five and a half feet in height.  They are stocky and rather
powerfully-built, and both males and females proudly wear thick and
often long beards.

Individuals of the race are deceptively quick, but not agile.  Still,
their thick and stout frames lend them an uncommon constitution and
strength, and the race has produced some of the most famed and feared
warriors in the Realms.  Dwarves may become accomplished magic users,
but they are more suited to physical roles.  They are &Gresistant to
flame&w, and generations of working with and within the earth has
fostered their &Ginfravision.&w

Dwarves can follow the ways of the following classes:
Cleric Thief Warrior Vampire Druid Ranger Augurer

Dwarves gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 0.97.  The dwarven
nation lies in the canyons northeast of the great western lake.
~

1 'DWARVEN CATACOMBS'~
Recommended level range: 10 - 20

The Dwarven Catacombs were once a series of mines laced with
veins of gold and silver. After many years, they were emptied of all
valuable minerals and abandoned. As time passed, monsters began
to inhabit the forsaken mines. Some even say a dragon has taken up
residence here. It is a well known fact that a cult of templars has
claimed the dark tunnels as their own and has established a stronghold
deep beneath the earth. Among the other rumors told of this land is the
tale of Excalibur: a lost blade of magical might. Most sages believe that
the ancient sword is located elsewhere however...
~

1 'DWARVEN DAYCARE'~
Recommended level range: 1 - 5

The dwarven daycare lies in the southern portion of the Dwarven
Kingdom. It is here that the stout dwarven miners leave their children
for the day while they procure ore in the vast underground mines. A
large number of female dwarves are employed here. Most are nannies,
given the duties of caring for and feeding the children.
~

1 'DWARVEN VILLAGE'~
Recommended level range: 10 - 35

The ancient dwarven race resides in this village far below the ground.
The stocky dwarves make a handsome living by selling the gold and
silver found in their mines. They have grown accustomed to humans
over the years and now invite the companionship of 'the big people.'
~

0 DYLAN 'DYLAN AREA' 'DYLANS AREA'~
Recommended level range: 15 - 25
 
Clouds have plagued the skies south of Darkhaven since the dawn of Despair. 
None know the cause of this, but many speculate that the vicious harpies and 
air elementals who rule these skies weave the clouds through powerful magic. 
It provides both races with a haven and also camouflage for hiding from 
predators and sneaking up on prey. Thankfully, these beings never descend 
from the skies and assail the races of Light.
~

0 EARTHQUAKE~
Syntax: cast 'earthquake'

This spell inflicts damage on every enemy character in the room.
Beware that other characters who are not yet fighting may attack
you as a result!
 
Be aware that area attacks are aggressive to all mobs in the room,
including pets, mounts and charmed creatures.
~

0 EAT DRINK~
Syntax:  drink <object>                  (drink liquid from a drink container)
Syntax:  eat   <object>                  (eat food or a magical pill)
         eat   <object> <container>      (eat directly from a container)
 
Drink instructs your character to drink from a fountain or a drink container
to alleviate thirst.
 
Eat instructs your character to eat an item of food or a magical pill (which
function in a similar fashion as potions); pills do not fill stomach space.
 
When you are hungry or thirsty (you will see messages at each tick that
tell you if you are starving or dying of thirst, and can check your
current state with either 'score' or 'oldscore'), you will not regain
hitpoints, movement points or mana back as rapidly as if you were well
fed and hydrated.
 
If you stay hungry or thirsty too long and you are not an Avatar, your
mental state will begin to suffer.  Your combat skills will be affected,
your coordination will suffer and you may begin to either hallucinate or
become depressed.  Eating, drinking and a little rest will solve this
problem after a short period of time.
 
See MENTALSTATES
~

1 EATING DRINKING HUNGER THIRST~
Eating and drinking are very important...
 
If you let yourself starve or dehydrate, your mental state will be affected,
and you may have problems performing even the simplest of tasks.
 
Typing 'score' will give you an indication of your current mental state.
('oldscore' will also show this information)
 
Sitting, resting and sleeping will increasingly contribute to better your
mental state (if done while not starving/dehydrating).
 
Being hurt badly in battle ("That really did HURT", and "You wish that your
wounds would stop BLEEDING so much!") as well as poisoning will also have a
rapid negative affect on your mental state.
 
~

52 ECHO RECHO~
Syntax:  echo      <color> <message>
         echo  imm <color> <message>
         echo  pc  <color> <message>
Syntax:  recho     <color> <message>
 
ECHO sends a message to all players in the game, without any prefix indicating
who sent it.  If 'echo imm <message>' is used, only level 51+ characters will 
see the message. If 'echo pc <message>' is used, only player characters will 
see the message. Echos should always adhere to the guidelines laid out in the 
Realm of Order (vnum 1214).
 
ECHO done in color should avoid the use of red and dark red unless it is a 
Urgent message containing important information related to the game.

RECHO sends a message to all players in your room, without any prefix
indicating who sent it.
 
See also : COLOR 'IMM ECHO'
~

51 ECONOMY~
Each area will initialize (on bootup of the mud) with a pool of gold based
on the area's range and the wealth of each mob in that area.
 
The shopkeepers and thieves will automatically deposit gold into the economy
if they are carrying more than a certain amount (the higher the level of the
shopkeeper, the greater they will carry before depositing).
 
To allow mobprogs to be created to manipulate area economies, making them
interactive and interdependent, there are two mpcommands:  mpdeposit, and
mpwithdraw (see related helpfiles).  There is also an 'if economy' ifcheck.
 
The aset command can also be used to adjust an area's economy by hand
(example:  aset <area filename> low_economy <amount>, this will give
the specified area a minimum economy at the level you set).
 
Mobs will not repop with more gold than what they were originally created
with, but if the area economy runs low they will begin to repop with less
until the economy is replenished (as they all share the same gold pool).
 
Use foldarea to make changes to an area's economy with aset permanent.
 
See ASET, FOLDAREA
~

1 EDITOR~
The Realms of Despair Editor is used when you're writing mail, notes,
your bio, description or other long bodies of text.
The commands in the editor are (these commands are shown with a space
between the / and the  command letter.  Omit the space when using the
commands in your notes):

/ ?              Displays editor help.
/ l              Lists the current contents of the note.
/ c              Clears the current contents of the note.
/ d [line]       Delete line. If no line number is given, the most
                  recent line is deleted.
/ g <line>       Goto line. This is useful for inserting lines,
                  deleting and fixing lines, etc.
/ i <line>       Insert line. Inserts a new blank line where specified.
/ r <old> <new>  Global replace. '/g' to the line you want to start
                  replacing at first, or no occurrences will be found.
/ a              Abort editing. No changes you made are kept.
/ ! <command>    Execute mud command. '/! smile' sends the smile
                  command, without exiting the editor.
/ s              Save buffer, and exit the editor.

2 EDMOND~
.   Some days after the world began, but more before now than after then, a
half-troll was born to a family afar off beyond the Azure Sea.  His youth was
uneventful, as adventures go, a brute of a boy and raised to kill, and hunt,
and eat all that he had, of course no different than most half-trolls you might
have heard of. His life was inexoribly changed though as he approached his
twentieth year and he met a young sea-elf.
 
    The young sea-elf was an odd match for such a large creature, the two of
whom would not have normally met, save for the travelling of the young
half-troll across the Azure Sea to the land you are familiar with.  Upon the
shores of Ocean Keep, they met, and over some further meetings of which there
is not enough space to write, they secretly left the city of Ocean Keep to wed
and carry on.  A more unnatural matrimony there may never have been, though
these days all nature of weddings have occurred.  This is how Edmond went from
just plain Edmond, to Edmond Nomaihr, taking on the last name of Rhiamon, as it
was the custom of her family.
 
    For some time, the family Nomaihr lived in peace and quiet, Edmond slowly
being accepted into the Nomaihr name, and soon enough was taken under Rhiamon's
mother's care as Rhiamon was soon to be named the Matriarch of the Nomaihr
family.  Sadly, too soon after Rhiamon was made the Matriarch of the Nomaihr
family, robbers came as quietly in the night and slew her, seeking the trinkets
about her neck and wrists.  A hefty price for the small jewels and things that
would have quickly been given.  This makes another dissertation on things of
crime and thievery which is not nearly the intent of this tale.
 
    The aging half-troll took to himself, and wandered the lands, seeking
those that destroyed his only real belongings with a wave of their daggers.
During these travels, he apprenticed in the mountains the augury now so
attached to his name.  To more clearly understand these ways he descended the
mountains into Darkhaven to study within the Guild of Augurers.  Here, he honed
his skills, and learned the ways of the lands.  He became a professional and
made his mark on the people about him.
 
    Some time after the destruction and rebuilding of the Guild of his nature,
of which another book could be written, the hands of the gods reached out of
the heavens, seeing that he might be of use to them, either as a tool, or toy,
one still cannot be sure.  That, now some many millenia ago, is how Edmond
arose to immortality.

1 ELBOW~
Syntax:  elbow
 
The fighter ducks suddenly to the left and comes up with a smashing elbow to

This powerful spell increases your resistance to both magical and nonmagical
attacks.
~

1 'ELEMENTAL CANYON'~
Recommended level range: 5 - 30

The immense elemental canyon lies on the southern border of the dark
dwarven forest. Once, long ago, the canyon was a flat portion of the
forest, yet the workings of a powerful elder mage destroyed the
landscape surrounding his, or her, home. As a backlash from his
wielding of elemental magics, strange entities formed of the very
elements were formed. These magical beings staked out land in the
newly created canyon and now wage a war amongst each other. Little
else is known about these eerie beings and their war, for none have
ever managed to communicate with the inhabitants of the canyon.

0 ELF ELVES~
Tall, slender creatures with an affinity for the woods and nature, Elves
were one of the First Three - the three original races fashioned and
scattered across the Realms.

Most elves stand taller than most humans, being six feet and often well
over that in height.  They tend to be fair-skinned with long, straight
hair, although there are individuals who choose a darker life which is
reflected in their outward appearance.

Elves are lighter-framed than humans, but what they lack in strength and
stamina is made up for with their superior agility - both in thought and
movement.  They are capable in most classes, though they function poorest
in the role of pure fighter.  Most will prefer to stay close to nature,
and many become druids.  All elves have the inherent &Gability to detect
magic &win the world around them, and are &Gresistant to cold.&w

Elves can follow the ways of the following classes:
Mage Cleric Thief Warrior Vampire Druid Ranger Augurer Paladin

Elves gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 1.1.  The Elf nation
lies on the island of Irrybis.

~

51 EXCUSE~
Invariably, after a character realizes that perhaps messing with the
Gods was not a bright thing to do, an innocent sounding alternate
appears from nowhere and claims that they would never do such a thing
as they were being accused of. After this, a couple of variations may
follow:
1) It was my little brother. (Not sure why it's never a little sister) 
   Person will claim a little brother stole their passwords, created
   havoc with their characters ..but now they have killed said sibling
   and promise there will be no further problems.
 
2) Even though there were 600 chars below 10 causing chaos from the 
   exact same ip, the char that was nuked (The avatar with all the
   gold and eq) was in no way involved and doesnt know how someone
   accessed his chars and computer site to do evil.
 
~

1 EXECRATE~
Syntax: cast execrate
 
An execration is a powerful curse that should not be used without 
much forethought. It will affect all within the reach of the Nephandi.

~

53 EXITMAKING~
The 'redit exit' command is used to create, modify and remove exits in a room.
Currently there can only be one exit in a certain direction.
The syntax of the 'redit exit' command is as follows:
redit exit <direction> [vnum] [exit-type] [key] [keyword(s)]
direction: one of: n, s, e, w, u, d, ne, nw, se, sw or ?
vnum     : the room number in which the exit leads to.
exit-type: a number detailing the exit -- has a door, open/closed/locked etc.
key      : a number corresponding to a key object which can unlock the door.
keywords : keywords used to refer to the door, (or exit).

If only 'redit exit <direction>' is specified, the exit will be removed.
The 'key' field is optional when specifying keywords.  All other fields are
required previous to the field desired.

Examples:
redit exit n 3001           - Creates an exit north to room 3001
redit exit n 3001 3 gate    - Changes the exit north to have a closed "gate"
redit exit n 3001 3 15 gate - Changes the gate to allow use of a key vnum 15
redit exit n                - Removes the north exit

See EXITTYPES for generating the exit-type value.
~

0 EXITS~
Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.
You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits.  (Try to walk in a
certain direction and see what you bump into).
~

53 EXITTYPES~
These are the currently valid exit-types:
      0 - Plain exit
      1 - Door exists         (Required to be closed or locked)
      2 - Door is Closed
      4 - Door is Locked
      8 - Door is Secret      (Trying to go that way won't reveal door)
     32 - Door is Pickproof   (Door can't be picked by spell or skill)
     64 - Need to be able to fly to go that way
    128 - Need to be able to climb to go that way
   1024 - Door is Passdoor proof

NOTE: You must ADD the values together to generate an exit-type:
        3 = a closed door
        7 = a closed and locked door
       11 = a closed secret door
       15 = a closed, locked and secret door

-- Use the 'redit exflags' command to change these flags, and to set the
   advanced exit flags, most of which are not shown above.

See EXFLAGS and EXITMAKING.

1 EXORCISM~

0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~

You lose experience by:
    fleeing from combat
    recalling out of combat
    being the target of some spells (energy drain, etc.)
    dying
 
The experience you get from a kill depends on several things:  how many 
players are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster;
your alignment versus the monster's alignment and some random variation.
 
Your last 50 kills are recorded.  Each time you kill a creature that has
been one of your last 50 kills you will receive less and less exp for it.

advantage over you in combat.

0 'EXTRADIMENSIONAL PORTAL' 'EXTRADIMENSIONAL'~
The Great Wizard Thanatos, after creating his fabled WarMagicks,
found himself snubbed and abused in and about The Realms for his
researches.  Much time would pass before mages and other classes
alike would learn the true power of these spells.
 
In the interim, disguised as an assassin, Thanatos became interested
in a more minor problem: that of carrying off the loot he gained
from all those he slew with Quantum Spike.  Realising that such a
formula would be easily grasped by his class, he thought to extend
it freely.
 
As a final touch to the spell, he thought he would spite those of
other classes by inbuing into these containers a quality which made
them uninvokable by the other classes.

0 FLY~
Syntax:  cast 'fly' <character>
 
This spell enables the target character to fly.  It is useful in saving
mv (movement points), preventing a character from falling when in the
air, moving over water or through the air, and in preventing an opponent
from tripping you.
 
Some water areas require the use of fly to prevent damage from drowning.
If you are in an area and your movement suddenly begins to drop, then you
begin losing hps <hitpoints>, you should cast fly immediately.
~

59 FOLDAREA~
Syntax:  foldarea <area filename>
 
This command saves an area file, usually after modification.
 
&rThis command must be used with extreme care.  If you aren't
exactly and intimately familiar with the changes being made
or what the command does -- don't use it.&w
 
*NOTE* 
Area files have backups that record the file as it was prior to foldarea.
If you folda something and realize there's a mistake, and you've only
folded it once -- don't do anything else.  Post a note or find Blodkai.
 
Do not fold changes into non-quest areas that are quest related.  If you
must do this, write a note or ensure it's changed back.
 
Any time an area is folded, document it with the fixed command.
(check 'help fixed')
 
See ASET, UNFOLDAREA and INSTALLAREA.

56 GAMERULES~
Each dice roll is scored as follows:
 
Three of a kind score 100*face value of one of the dice. If the face value is
1, then it is scored as 1000. For each extra die of the same face value, the
score is doubled. (ie. 4 6's would be 1200)
 
Single 1's and 5's score 100 and 50, respectively.
 
A straight, i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 scores 1500.
 
In order to get "on the board", you have to roll at least 300.  Until you roll
300, you cannot save your first score.  After you are on the board you may save
as little as you want.

1 GAUNTLET~
Since the discovery of the SENTINEL, by a group of brave adventurers,
the story of its purpose and history has unfolded, and now it is known

0 GITH~
The Gith are a race descended from humans.  Once long ago, they were a
peaceful civilization of humans that were captured by mind flayers and
tormented for centuries.  Eventually, a savior named Gith led them to
freedom, yet their bodies had been flayed by the mental powers of the
illithids.  The Gith found themselves stronger, quicker, luckier and
smarter than average humans, yet they had lost much of their faith,
wisdom, stamina and charisma.
 
They are yellow-skinned and very long of limb.  Sunken eyes peer from
yellowed sockets, now strangely capable of &Gnaturally detecting the
invisible&w.  The Gith race has split into three distinct groups:  the
good (Githzerai), the selfish neutral (Pirates of Gith) and the evil
(the Githyanki).
 
Gith's can follow the ways of the following classes:

syntax:  glance
syntax:  glance <victim>

condition, eliminating their description and equipment from your
screen.
 
Glance may be abbreviated as 'gl'.
~

0 GLORY~
Glory is a measure of how valiant you are, and is accumulated by taking part
in quests (mostly) and possibly in a few other ways in the near to distant
future.  It appears on your score screen as:
 
                    Glory: 264(430)
 
  The number in parentheses is the total lifetime glory attained by your
character, and the other number is your current glory.  Glory can be "spent"
to improve your items and weapons (among possible other things in the future)
as according to the scale detailed in HELP GLORY RATES.
 
   Unlike Quest Points of old, Glory will not only go to the "winner" of the
quest, but will be awarded on a basis of participation.  For example, the big
prize might not only go to the person who killed the monster,  but also to
the person who solved the riddle first, etc.  Players who took part in the
quest and helped a notable amount will also receive lesser amounts of Glory.
 
   Glory cannot be traded or transferred between characters or pooled
from multiple characters.  This would be like Odysseus passing all the
renown for his deeds off onto someone else.

51 GLORYIMM~
UNDER CONSTRUCTION - NOT VALID RATES 7/2/01

Some things to keep in mind when giving/taking Glory:
 
  - Glory is UNtradable between mortals.  (Please do not facilitate trades of
         Glory between mortals.
  - It is allowed for a player to use his Glory to affect items for another
         player.
  - Currently, appropriate prizes to be awarded for quests are as follows:
 
  Avatar quests (lvl 40+):
Suggested Maximum: 30 glory (For playing an integral part)
         Suggested Minimum:   5 Glory  (For making a notable effort)
    - Then Glory of appropriate amounts (use your judgement) can be given out
         for intermediate efforts between winning and participating.
 
  NOTE:  Being integral doesn't necessarily mean landing the killing blow on
         the supermob, it might also mean the person who solved the riddle
         leading to the mob (if it was a difficult riddle).
  NOTE:  Prizes should be scaled up or down to reflect the difficulty and
         participation of the quest.  For example a difficult quest would be
         one that takes more than 2 hours to complete.
 
  Non-Avatar quests (lvl < 40):
         Suggested Maximum:  35 Glory  (For an integral part)
         Suggested Minimum:   5 Glory  (For a notable effort)
~

51 GLORYIMM2~
.    Glory does not necessarily have to be the only prize given out. In fact
     for the lower level quests it is preferred if a combination of Glory and
     minorly affected/renamed objects are given out as prizes.  i.e. a weapon
     renamed to something related to the quest that has a couple +1's or +2's
     on it (that will be useful for a couple levels, but then discarded).
 
     NOTE:  It is suggested for Guild and Order quests that the prizes be
            scaled down slightly as participation is limited from the entire
            mud - and open exclusively to guild/order members.  The quests they
            receive from the guild/order are supplemental to the mud-wide ones
            they can participate in.
 
 
     DISCLAIMER:  These numbers are not set in stone, they are guidelines.  The
                  QC is counting on the good judgement of the immortals to
                  make sure the prizes they are giving out are appropriate.
                  The QC reserves the right to change the guidelines as well
                  the right to set them in stone if we find it is being abused.

-1 GNOME GNOMES~
Gnomes are a quirky demi-human race.  Though not the mightiest of
races, they are well versed in their studies of knowledges, magics
and religions.  Most often prefer an evening at home with a magical
tome, a loaf of pipeweed bread and a cup of ale over venturing out
to battle.

Most gnomes are short and stocky, similar to their dwarven cousins.
They usually focus in the magical or clerical arts, though a few
rogues have ventured into the arts of thieving (albeit often not
very well).

Gnomes have &Ginnate infravision&w, and due to their familiarity with
magical and religious lore they are &Gable to detect magic&w in the
environment around them.  They are somewhat &Gresistant to energy&w
based magic, but also somewhat &Gsusceptible to fire&w.

Gnomes can follow the ways of the following classes:
Mage Cleric Thief Druid Augurer

Gnomes gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 1.2.

~

1 GODS~
The domains of Despair's Gods are often terror-filled and designed
to horrify and shock any mortal visitors. None have ever discovered
an entrance to any of these domains, for they are guarded by the
most powerful of godly magics.
~

50 GOHOME~
Syntax:  gohome
 
This command allows you to "recall" to your house.  It is restricted in the
same fashions that 'word of recall' is. It is magical, and will therefore not
work where the spell will not work.
~

1 GOLD~
Syntax:  gold
 
Displays the current total amount of gold you are carrying.

Be aware that a character can only hold 2147483647, any more than
that and you will end up with negative gold, which will not be
reimbursed. Please be advised that no immortal will reset your gold level
to 0, it is your personal responsibility to monitor your gold. Keep in
mind that going over the gold limit will essentially render your character
useless, so please be careful.

62 GORY TRADE~
~

51 GOTO~
Syntax: goto <location>

GOTO takes you to a location.  The location may be specified as a vnum,
as the name of a mobile, or as the name of an object.

If the location is a vnum, and it does not already exist, and it is within
your room vnum range, it shall be created for you to edit further with 
REDIT.

You may not GOTO a room if it is PRIVATE and has two (or more) characters
already present, or if it is SOLITARY and has one (or more) characters
already present.

You may also "GOTO pk" to go to the site of the most recent illegal pkill.
See REDIT.
~

1 GOUGE~
syntax:  gouge
 
This attack can only be used in combat, and will strike at the eyes of
your opponent, causing damage and temporary blindness.
 
Note that gouge has a reduced chance of hitting if the gouger is not
one of the primary combatants (i.e. is not tanking).
 
See also BLIND, BLINDED
~

2 GRAPPLE~
Syntax:  grapple <victim>
 
A pkill-only skill, usable only between primary fighters (tanks), which
prevents the victim from fleeing for one or two rounds (depending).  The
victim can continue to fight, cast, heal, etc. during this time.  The
grappler is similarly unable to flee, but is also unable to carry out
commands or attacks of his own.
 
Note that the grapple will last either one or two rounds depending on
various factors.  This may be extended to a flat two rounds or otherwise
modified.  Both victim and attacker also suffer a penalty to dexterity.
 
Suggestions for any aspect of the skill are welcome.
~

1 GRASP 'GRASP SUSPIRIA'~
Syntax:  grasp
 
The suspiric grasp is the vampire's most lethal attack, allowing it to
drain the life of its opponent in larger quantities than nearly any
other skill or spell in the Realms.  The more intelligent is the
vampire, the more effectively it will perform this loathsome act.  Be
aware that the magical nature of this attack causes it to be affected
by the victim's saves.
 
~

1 GRAVEYARD~
Recommended level range: 5 - 10

Darkhaven's graveyard was once a peaceful burial ground, visited by
grieving citizens and tended by gentle priests. However, a powerful
curse was cast upon this land by an unknown mage. Within days, the
soft brown earth had turned black and sooty. A year later, the dead
began to claw their way out of the earth, roaming the graveyard in
search of flesh. Though many have tried to lift the curse on this
small plot of land, none of these attempts have succeeded. Some sages
believe that an elder God of evil protects the curse of the graveyard.
~

1 GRAVOC~
Gravoc is overseer of those that have chosen the path of pkiller.
Instilling knowledge into the souls of darkness, deadly players
find his presence invaluable to the strengthening and growth of
the hatred they possess for all forms of life.
 
~

1 'GREAT EASTERN DESERT'~
Recommended level range: 10 - 20
 
The Great Eastern Desert lies far to the east of Darkhaven, just south
of the majestic New Thalos. It is a barren wasteland, inhabitated only
by nomads and desert wildlife. Those who have found shelter from the
sweltering sun often describe an encounter with a great brass dragon who
resides in a chamber which prevents the usage of magic...
~

1 'GREEN FOREST'~
Recommended level range 2-15

North of Darkhaven's city walls, uncleared forest remains. Having survived
the construction of the city the forest retained its ancient natural
balance. The woodland creatures have come back and made the Green Forest a
bountiful hunting ground for hunters experienced or foolish enough to brave
the trails and whatever else might be hunting in the darkness amongst the
thick, ancient trees.

This skill is automatic, once practiced.  The skill causes you to grip
your weapon tightly as someone tries to disarm you, making it far more
difficult to successfully disarm you.  This skill will only increase as
you are engaged in fights where someone is attempting to disarm you.

63 'GROUP DISPLAYER'~
~

1 GROUP GROUPING~
Syntax:  group <character>, group all, group, group disband
 
'Group <character>' adds someone who is following you into your group, making
them a group member.  Group members share experience from kills, and may use
the GTELL and SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will
automatically join the fight.
 
If character is already a member of your group, 'group <character>' again to
remove them from your party.  Removing the character from the group does not
stop them from following you, however.  A character can also leave a group
by using the 'follow self' command, in which case they will both leave your
group and stop following you.
 
'Group' with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.
 
'Group all' groups all eligible players following you in the room.
 
'Group disband' allows the leader to disband his group (members will stop
following and are ungrouped).
 
You may group only characters within eight levels of your own.  See section
18 of your Adventurer's Guide for more information on groups and grouping.

You always need to specify the number of lines you want displayed. The
reason for that is that we don't want to ask for a list and then get
surprised to find that it's 15,000 lines long. You can get a count
of the players that match your criteria by requesting zero lines.
 
GRUB will tell you how many lines there are in the list no matter how
many you ask to display. So if there are 15,000 players that meet your
criteria and you ask for the first ten, GRUB will tell you there are
15,000 in total but will only show you the first ten.

55 'GRUB EXAMPLES'~
Here are some examples illustrating common usages:
 
Example:
 
grub 20 or hitroll>150 damroll>150 gold>200000000
 
Suppose you want to search for "suspicious players". Suppose you want
to see players who have more than 200 million gold or whose damroll
exceeds 150 or whose hitroll exceeds 150 you can do that as follows:
 
Normally GRUB lists players who satisfy all the conditions you specify.
But it can also be used like this to list players who satisfy any one of
the conditions.
 
The operand "or" ensures GRUB will list players who satisfy any one of
the conditions.
 
If you had specified:
 
grub 20 hitroll>150 damroll>150 gold>200000000
 
That would show you players whose hitroll exceeds 150 and whose damroll
exceeds 150 and whose gold exceeds 200 million. It would be a much
smaller list and you would miss many suspicous players.
 
Example:
 
grub 20 name>ska name<skb room>=21000 room<=21499
 
Suppose someone complains that a player with a name like "Skathamaga"
picked up some of their eq and promptly quit the game. The player isn't
sure of the exact name of the thief but is sure it starts with "Ska".
The thief quit the game somewhere in New Darkhaven (vnums 21000-21499).
 
This example will show you players whose name starts with "Ska" and who
last quit the mud somewhere in New Darkhaven.

Syntax:  tell    <target> <message>
Syntax:  whisper <target> <message>
Syntax:  reply            <message>
Syntax:  retell           <message>

All of these commands send messages to other players.

- SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The '
  (single quote) character is a synonym for SAY.
- SAYTO sends a message to a particular player in your room,
  and is seen by all awake players in your room.  The synonym
  for SAYTO is the < character.
- GTELL sends a message to all of the characters in your group,
  wherever they are, even if they are sleeping, stunned or dying.
  The ; (semicolon) character is a synonym for GTELL.
- TELL sends a private message to a particular player anywhere
  in the Realms.
- WHISPER sends a private message to another player in your room.
  Others in the room see only that you are whispering.
- REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.
  REPLY will work even if you can't see the player, and without
  revealing their identity.  This is handy for talking to invisible
  players (who appear as "Someone") or switched immortal players.
- RETELL sends a REPLY to the last person you sent a TELL to.  This
  is handy for talking to an invisible person if someone else sends
  you a tell in the middle of your conversation and you can no
  longer REPLY to the invisible party.

2 GUILD GUILDS~
Guilds are special organizations for each class within the realms. Belonging
to a Guild has many advantages, such as gaining new knowledge of your class,
making new friends in the Realms, exciting quests, the great feeling of 
helping other players, and many other aspects of Guild life make being in a
Guild a memorable experience.  Each Guild has its own separate headquarter
with a healer, a practice room, a Guild store, and many other rooms that makes
each Guild unique unto itself.
 
Membership in a Guild is not something that is easily obtained, and you must
be a law-abiding player.  Deadly players are not allowed to join Guilds.
There are rules within each Guild, and along with these rules, you must
follow the rules of the Realms of Despair.
 
To gain entry into a Guild, you should find the recruiting office of that 
guild, then read the recruiting board which you will find there. The board will
contain instructions and rules about joining the guild and instructions on how 
to obtain a guide to the guild. To find out who is on from a Guild, type "who
'Guild of *****'.  For example, if you are a Druid, and you wish to find out 
who is on from the Guild of Druids, type "who 'Guild of Druids'", and you will
be given a list of players that belong to the Guild.
 
Type &Ghelp guild rules&w for a list of rules about Guild equipment and items.
 
You can also use 'guilds <guild name>' to view information about the
specified guild.
 
Type 'guilds' to see a list of existing guilds.

2 'GUILD RULES'~
.
&RIt is illegal to sell, trade, auction or give away Guild items.&w Including
potions, pills, scrolls, equipment and containers.  Anything you can buy in
a Guild house is off limits for selling.  If you are found to be trading in
these illegal items, you stand the chance of not only being outcast from your
Guild, but your Guild may lose the ability to sell those items.
 
Please do not engage in buying such items either, as the Immortals reserve
the right to remove Guild items from ANY person not belonging to that Guild.
Just because you can buy it on the "black market" does not mean the Immortals
will allow you to keep it.
 
If you are in doubt whether an item is a Guild item, you are free to ask an
Immortal. Most Guild items have the name "guild" on it when you use identify.
 
There are rules that are specific to Guilds.  If you are not sure if something
is legal or illegal within your Guild, please contact a leader.

0 HALF-ELF HALFELF HALFELVES~
These beautiful creatures are the result of the mixing of human and Elven
blood in ages past, and have so freely intermingled in the open societies
of the Realms since their inception that their mixed heritage is of no
consequence.

Though not as tall as the pure Elf, they are nevertheless a rather tall
race ranging from five feet six inches to six feet five inches in height.
They additionally carry a slightly more musculature build than the pure
Elf.

Though the half-elf is not as intelligent as the pure-blooded Elf, nor as
hardy as the full-blooded human, this mix serves quite well in a variety of
classes which require the standards of both mental and physical prowess.
The beautiful almond eyes of the half-elf enable them to &Gdiscern objects
in the darkness&w, and they have an inherent &Gresistance to cold&w.

Half-Elves can follow the ways of the following classes:
Mage Cleric Thief Warrior Vampire Druid Ranger Paladin

Half-Elves gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 1.04.
~

0 HALF-OGRE HALFOGRE~
The half-ogre is a result of forced breeding in the dark time
with humans, when pure-blooded Ogres were known for raping and
looting human villages.  Like other half-breeds, the half-ogre
was shunned by the full-blooded Ogre race and eventually loosely
assimilated with the human civilizations in the lands surrounding
New Darkhaven.

Half-ogres stand roughly upright, range from six to almost nine
feet height, and even females generally pack well over 300 pounds
on their immense frames.  Most are relatively hairless, and their
bodies are instead covered with small, boney growths.  Their
disproportionately long limbs lend a somewhat simian appearance.

Half-ogres inherit great physical abilities:  an good aptitude for
aggression, inherent &Ginfravision&w to assist in travel through
darkness, and though smaller than pure-bred Ogres the half-ogre
nevertheless boasts &Gawesome strength&w.  All in all, the race is
best-suited for the role of pure fighter.
 
Half-ogres can follow the ways of the following classes:
Thief Warrior Vampire

Half-ogres gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 0.92.
The half-ogre nation lies at Opallinoc in the northern plains.

~

0 HALF-ORC HALF-ORCS HALFORC HALFORCS~
&wA recent mingling of Orcish and Human blood arising as the darker races
have encroached further upon the remaining settled areas, most members
of this half-blooded race are distinctly more Orcish than Human in both
appearance and behavior.

Though not as broad nor powerful as full-blood Orcs, Half-Orcs usually
retain their wider bodies, longer, bowed limbs and heavier musculature.
A ridged brow crowned by bushy eyebrows conceals small, squinting eyes;
below a snout-like noses opens a maw filled with crooked fangs; dark
skin emanating a rancid odor; their presence disgusts civilized races.

Large and dull of wit, with broad bodies, their poor mental and physical
dexterity is offset by an iron constitution.  Though some have dabbled in
the sorcerous arts due to their human influence, brute combat is still
the natural call which stirs in the soul of the Half-Orc.  All Half-Orcs
possess &Ginfravision&w, and most stand from five to seven feet tall and
averaging two hundred pounds.  An altogether fearsome race.
 
Half-Orc's can follow the ways of the following classes:
Thief Warrior Vampire

Half-Orc's gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 0.94.
~

0 HALF-TROLL HALFTROLL~
An intermingling (carried out in the darker lands of the Realms) of the
blood of the Troll with that of Humans, the Half-troll is as deadly as
it is hideous.  Though considerably smaller than full-blood Trolls, the
Half-troll often stands well over eight feet in height and carries over
three hundred pounds on its heavily-muscled frame.
 
Owing in part to the black blood which courses through their heavy veins,
the heavily-scaled skin of the Half-troll ranges in color from a charcoal
grey to a deep, blackish green.  Half-trolls revel in the fright of their
appearance, often wearing their hair in battle-braids and emblazoning
themselves with brands and tattoos to accentuate the effect.
Though naturally of low wisdom, the race was sorcerously imbued with a
wicked intelligence and the ability to see naturally in the darkness.
Half-trolls usually make poor pure magic users, and suffer from an
unusually low dexterity.  Yet their boundless energy and high intellect
create one of the most cunning physical beasts of the Realms in
experienced hands.  Half-trolls are all but immune to most poisons.

Half-Trolls can follow the ways of the following classes:
Thief Warrior Vampire Augurer

Half-Trolls gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 0.90.
~

0 HALFLING HALFLINGS~
Stout, round, open-minded and very elusive the Hobbit has a level of
dexterity which is only equal to his wit.  Many enjoy the thrill of
reading a good book, or telling stories by the fire.  Many halflings,
because of this, tend to avoid adventuring, though some rare hobbits
choose the path of the Bard, or storyteller, for their keen intellect
serves them well.  This intelligence, coupled with a surprising
determination makes them a curious (though somewhat underpowered)
ally.

Individuals have compact bodies and thick, long limbs, and usually have
very hairy feet.  Eye colors range from blue to brown to green, and
any shade inbetween.

Halflings have an &Ginnate ability to detect evil&w around them, as
well as uncanny &Gability to sneak&w unseen.

Halflings can follow the ways of the following classes:
Thief Warrior Vampire Ranger

Halflings gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 1.02.
~

1 HALLUCINATE~
Syntax : cast hallucinate <victim> <msg>
 
The power to invade one's mind and cause them to see what you wish them
to.
~

1 'HAON DOR'~
Recommended level range: 5 - 10

The immense forest of Haon Dor stretches westward from Darkhaven,
swallowing much of Despair's western landscape. It is a dangerous
forest, populated by many aggressive creatures: wargs and wolves
among them. A single beast rules the forest, given the name Froghemoth
by those who have survived its wrath. Obvious paths to the Shire,
Old Marsh and the city of Solace can be found in Haon Dor, as well as
hidden ones to various other places in Despair.
~

1 'HAUNTED HOUSE'~
Recommended level range: 20 - 50
 
Should you stumble into a lonely inn one night, seeking a hot meal and a place
to rest, it is quite possible that you will hear a bard tell the story of a
strange, mystical house that was inhabited by an evil, eccentric sorceror.
Murdered by one of the very beasts he created, the house was left abandoned
to be overrun by the strange beings spawned by the sorceror.  It is rumoured
that the house even nowadays remains haunted by these odd, powerful creatures.
The house now lies in the midst of the Midway of Despair, open for all those
adventurers who are brave (or foolish) enough to enter.
 
~

1 HEADBUTT~
Syntax:  headbutt
 
Headbutt is a skill that is performed exactly as the name implies; by
employing ones head as a weapon to their opponent. If successful, the
skill inflicts damage to the main opponent. NOTE: This skill may be
used to start fights so should not be used on your fellow players
unless under pkill conditions.
~

54 HEDIT~
Syntax: hedit [help topic]
 
This command allows you to edit a help topic.  If the specified help topic
does not exist, it will be created for you. The default help page (summary)
will be selected if you do not specify a page.
 
NOTE - Always, when creating a new help entry, type Help <new entry name> 
       prior to creating your entry. A pre-existing help file associated 
       with that keyword may already exist.
&Y
Colors &wcan now be added to help files using the same command set that changes
a player's prompt. &bMultiple &Ycolor &wcombinations can be set on a given line
including ^bbackground^x colors. However there are a couple of quirks to take 
note of:
&Y
    1) At the very least, the first character of a help file cannot be
       either the symbol '&&' or the symbol '^^'.
    2) Color changes have to be separated by at least one character. ie,
       '&&Y.^^r' will work, '&&Y^^r' will cause problems. 
    3) Color codes are imbedded within text and _do_ count in note buffers
       for line length. ie, watch out for <Long Line Trimmed>.
&w
Colors should be used to &Yenhance &wthe help file, or specific parts of the 
help file. Tact and restraint should be used if considering the use of colors.
 
 
See HSET, PCOLORS.
~

51 HELL UNHELL~
Syntax: hell <character> <number> <hours or days>
Syntax: unhell <character>
 
The hell command sends a character to hell for a given period of time.  It
automatically releases the character when their time has been served.  Upon
being helled, the character receives the message, "The immortals are not
pleased with your actions.  You shall remain in hell for <time period>".
 
Hell takes arguments of either hours or days.  To hell someone for 3 hours,
"hell <character> 3 hours".  To hell someone for three days, "hell <character>
3 days".  Hell will default to hours if hours or days is not specified.
 
You may not hell someone for more than thirty days with the hell command.
 
To release a player from hell, simply "unhell <character>".
~

0 HELP HELPFILES HELPFILE~
The helpfile system of the Realms of Despair has been created to aid
game play as well as provide valuable information for players.
 
To access these files, type HELP topic and the information will appear.
If no help is available on that topic, similar helpfiles will be
suggested.  A list of sample topics can be seen under HELP START.
 
Before asking a question on a public channel or requesting help from
another player, try looking up the helpfile.  For example, try HELP LEVERS.
~

60 HELP KONTAUR~
Recommended level range:  25 - 50
 
 
Among the most corrupt of the lands of Despair, is Kontaur, which lies
south of the Old Marsh. Once a lush forest filled with wild vegetation
and beautiful sylvan and elven races, it is now the heart of evil in the
southern lands. The cause of the land's devastation is not completely
known. Sages believe that either Laschte or Vl'arescht opened a gate to
a race of astral travelers known as the Carnifex, which brought legions
of balrogs to Despair long ago. The balrogs waged war against all sentient
races, seeking to destroy at the leisure of their masters. The avatars of
Darkhaven were truly oppressed and fought for their very lives against
this evil army. After years of war, the Carnifex were finally driven across
the Pits of Banishment and into a legendary castle from which they could not
escape. Without their masters' guidance, the balrogs lost their edge and
began losing the war. They retreated to Kontaur, the first realm they had
conquered, and erected a castle. Although there have been many attempts to
destroy the Balrog race, none have succeeded. Many new races have come to
the forests of Kontaur recently, and made the Realms even more perilous.
Foul pixie that were corrupted by Laschte, savage beastmen and, Vl'arescht's
creation, the moblins, all guard paths to and from the kontaur castle.
Yet there lies a shining hope in this foul land, for A'enaar lifted her
hand and protected a tribe of forest elves known as the Misinkii.

1 HEZEKIAH HEZEKIAHS 'HEZEKIAHS CURE' HEZEKIAH'S~
Syntax:  c 'hezekiahs cure' <target>
          c hezekiahs        <target>
 
Hezekiah was a great Paladin for whom the Gods showed great pleasure.
As a reminder of his greatness, the Gods granted a spell in his honor.
The spell brings about a mild cure to the wounded, with the use of
the Paladin Holy Symbol.
~

1 HIDE SNEAK VISIBLE~
Syntax:  hide
Syntax:  sneak
Syntax:  visible
 
If you successfully hide, creatures cannot see you unless they are affected
by 'detect hidden'.  Player characters can detect you, however.
 
If you successfully sneak, you can move from place to place without being
noticed by other player characters.  If you flee, you will stop sneaking
and will have to 'sneak' again.
 
In order to either hide or sneak successfully, you will have to practice
the appropriate skill.
 
Visible (vis) cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,
effectively making you visible again to all.

1 'HIGH TOWER OF SORCERY'~
Recommended level range: 10 - 30

Ages ago, when the mortals of Despair were still experimenting with
magic, a coven of archmages deemed that the use of magic needed to
be learned and controlled to avoid terrible disasters. Thus the Guild
of Mages was created, along with the High Tower of Sorcery. After
many attacks from the beings of Darkness, the mages also found it
necessary to weave a powerful grove of shadows around the Tower, so
that only the stoutest adventurers could reach them. Since that time,
the mages of Despair, led by the powerful Mistress of Magic, have
attempted to grasp the idea of magic and understand how it truly works.
Recently, the Guild has gained such respect that Duke Luther has
permitted the building of a Tower of Sorcery in Darkhaven.

51 HISTORY~
At the Dawn of Time, Thoric made The First World, and elevated a hundred
mortals to godhood through divine ascension. The universe outside of The
First World slowly began to take shape, order being formed from chaos with
the guidance of The Hundred. The Supreme Entity then receded from the vision
of all mortals, for they held little sway over his creation. Soon after,
dozens of worlds were created, each one looked over by a small pantheon of
deities. It was the Age of Peace. There was no enmity between the Gods, for
all understood the importance of Balance. For thirty thousand years, the
universe knew bliss - until the Lord of Darkness struck.
 
  The Dark was one of The Hundred whom Thoric held in good favor, and
convened with regularly. This God detested the need to bicker and discuss its
plans with others, and thus plotted to eliminate the other Gods so that it
may rule supreme. Exploiting the silver magicks of Limbo, it weaved a plane
named Es'tilith. It then spent a thousand years convincing Thoric that a
"prison plane", made to house traitorous Gods, was needed - a place where
those who broke the Codex of Thoric could be kept for eternity. Thoric
finally complied, and enchanted the prison plane with the magicks necessary.
  The Lord of Darkness then summoned The Hundred in a display of magic that
will never be equaled. The Dark presented his void of retention to the other
gods as 'an unknown curiousity', encouraging The Hundred to explore the
plane. The Hundred, who greatly feared the wrath of The Dark, entered
Es'tilith, becoming trapped for eternity. Then the Age of Plea began.
 
~

51 HISTORY2~
For thirty thousand years, the trapped Gods pleaded to Thoric for freedom,
while The Dark weaved its lies across the mortal worlds, watching peace turn
to war, order to chaos. Thoric eventually acknowledged their cries and
declared that The Lord of Darkness' treachery was fate, and the Thousand
would remain forever trapped in Es'Tilith. The Supreme Entity then gave The
Lord of Darkness leave to destroy and remake the universe in his own vision.
  And so the universe was destroyed. Comforting Oblivion now reigned
over all. This peace did not last long however, as a powerful backlash
formed from The Lord of Darkness' wild magicks -- a strange intelligent
entity composed of the very essence of magic. It quickly morphed itself into
a new land -- giving birth to the Second World.
  As no life existed on this new world of sand, a monument to commemorate
life was grown first, which was called "The Tree of Life". Unexpectedly, from
this tree sprung creatures of all types - similar in appearance to life
before The Dark wielded Oblivion. New lands were created, and these slowly
spread outward from the Tree. Cities were founded, and life began anew.
  The Tree also blessed some beings with knowledge of the Old Ways. These few
mortals learned about the Lost Gods, and many took to worshipping them.
  The Dark eventually discovered this seed of Life within the vast void and,
with a mere divine thought, attempted to destroy it. As it was about to
eradicate the remains of this unnamed world, Thoric halted The Darks hand,
deeming that none would interfere with this interesting offspring of magic.
The Dark, ironically, was given the task of overseeing this world -- Despair.
 
~

51 HISTORY3~
Despair began as a world of natural splendor, yet has now been corrupted
over the ages by The Dark, and the Gods it has raised through divine
ascension. The peaceful mortals of this gothic world now find themselves
pressed into eternal war against The Dark. Beings of Light have become
increasingly rare, and under the guidance of a new goddess, A'enaar, a great
resistance has bound together -- the five towns light -- Solace, Ofcol, New
Thalos, Ocean Keep and Darkhaven. All the other Realms of Despair have
fallen, and thus does Good's hope falter and wither...

51 HITALL~
Syntax: hitall
 
Hitall is a fighter skill that will start a fight by hitting all the
opponents in the room.  For nondeadly characters, the 'opponents' means
mobs, for deadlies it means all the deadly players in the room.
 
Be aware that area attacks are aggressive to all mobs in the room,
including pets, mounts and charmed creatures.
~

53 HITROLL~
This leads us to topic number two. Hitroll. Once again, going back to table top
days, hitroll would have been more commonly called the sum of your hit 
modifiers. You sit at the table, or stand if you're really excited, and roll 
your 20 sided die. Your thac0 is 12 and the mob you are fighting has an armor 
class of -7.  You actually want to kill your partner, because he's got a thac0 
of 4 and has a much better chance of hitting this thing, but you meanwhile are 
about ready to become monster fodder. You are PRAYING for a critical hit, but 
alas, it wasn't to be. You rolled a 14. Best armor class you woulda hit was a 
-2. The table laughs at you. You sulk. "But Wait!" shouts the DM as you look 
up with hopeful eyes. That sword you found has a +3 hit modifier, and the 
shield you are wearing has a +2 hit modifier. You do some math, you ADD those  
(+5) to your die roll (14), and voila! You've in all actuality rolled a 19! 
You hit! Whoopeee!
 
So how does hitroll compare? Quite simply, the code does essentially the same 
thing. A player attacks a mob, the almighty DM, SMAUG, rolls his die for him, 
subtracts his hitroll from his thac0 (or adds it to his die roll) and spits 
out his chance of hitting the creature.
 
NOTE: A player cannot add hit modifiers to his die roll to cause a "critical 
hit" or "critical miss". Those must occur on the die roll.

~

1 HITROLL HR~
Represents your chances of hitting your opponent.  The higher
the number, the better.
 
~

1 HLIST~
Syntax: hlist <low level range> <high level range>
 
This command will give you a listing of available help files. The list
is in alphabetical order based on the first triggering keyword. While
this command was initially designed as a maintenance tool to help us
track help files, it is also available to players so that they can
capture a listing of the help files available to them. 
 
Note - You may only view help files that are coded for viewing by your
       level or lower.
 
Note - The list of help files is quite extensive, and the command does
       not as yet have a way to filter/shorten the list. Screen capture
       is, at present, your only recourse.

~

1 'HOLY GROVE'~
Recommended level range: 5 - 20

To the east of Darkhaven is the holy grove. A spiritual place 
populated by peaceful creatures and numerous druids, the only
danger in this holy place is the danger you bring with you. The
entrance to a portal through time itself can also be found in the
grove, though many an adventurer has been lost forever while
crossing through time...
~

1 'HOLY SANCTITY'~
Syntax:  c 'holy sanctity'
 
This spell casts sanctuary on every member of the cleric's group.
~

51 HOLYLIGHT INVIS~
Syntax: holylight
Syntax: invis

HOLYLIGHT is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

INVIS is a toggle which makes you completely invisible to all player characters
of lower level than you, and to all mobiles.

When an immortal is INVIS, they will have a flag on the who list which 
indicates their level of invisibility, such as (51) for INVIS 51.  A 
similar flag will also appear when you 'LOOK' in a room - this flag will 
say (Invis 51).

HOLYLIGHT will not allow you to see immortal INVIS characters who are
higher level than you.
~

1 HOMEBUY~
Syntax:  homebuy <argument>
 
Where the argument is one of:
 list
 show <# of auction item> 
 bid <# of auction item> <amount>

Using these commands you can determine which house you would like to purchase.
Inside the "homebuy list", an (a) next to the name of a house indicates that it
is an apartment.  Apartments differ from houses in that apartments can only be
one room and apartments do not save objects inside.
 
Sellers of houses not bid on will be charged up to a 20% gold penalty.
Bidders on houses that cannot support the bid by gold on their character at
time of sale will be charged up to a 20% penalty.  The house is then placed
back on auction.  Once the bid reaches maximum amount of gold possible to be
bid, the sale will be closed.
 
If you are the bidder or the seller and are not online at time of sale, your
gold will be adjusted automatically while you are offline.

 
&YNote: &wHouses may only be purchased by Avatars.

&RWhat is the &WHoRRoRSHoW&R, you ask? Well, let me try to elucidate. The
&WHoRRoRSHoW &Ris an assemblage of animas for the purpose of pleasing the
Enigmatic Gods. To let some blood. How do you play, you may ask? Simple
really: Qualify, pick a cohort and show up at the specified time to do
battle. Qualify by being online and fulfill whichever mini-quest is run
for the purpose.
 
Ten qualifying teams will compete for the final clash approximately five
weeks from the beginning of the &WHoRRoRSHoW &R- the triumphant team from each
round goes to the final, eight teams per round. (Qualifying teams from each
round are exempt from participating in any further qualifiers.) If your team
does not qualify in a round, you may try again in the next round.

-1 HOTELS~
Finding affordable accomodation for the reunion has been a difficult task
due to the Caribana festival happening in Toronto.   Most places have been
booked a year in advance, other have doubled their rates.
 
Fortunately we have located some very reasonably priced accomodation very
close to the reunion location.
 
The first place is at the Fifth Wheel Truck Stop in Milton.  Which is located
right at highway 25 and 401 (get off at exit 320) -- 40 Chisholm Drive.
The phone number is (905)878-8441.  I recommend getting reservations ASAP.
The price is about $55 CDN per night (About $35US), and it is about a ten
minute drive from the Renaissance Festival.
 
The other affordable location is the Halton Motel located at 3033 Dundas St.
West. (which is just a few minutes East of the Highway 403, Dundas exit).
The phone number is (905)828-6900.  This place is also not far from the
Renaissance Festival, and is also located in the same place most of the
other activities will be going on.   Their rooms are around $53 CDN per night.
 
If you want a more luxurious place to stay, call 1-800-363-6400, and
choose either the Airport (especially if you are flying into town) or the
Oakville location (which would be closer to the reunion).  The "Toronto West"
location is also acceptable.

1 HOUSE~
Syntax:  house <argument>
 
Where the argument is one of:
 name <Desired Title of Room>
 desc
 addroom <direction>
 givekey
 
These commands allow you to modify your house in many ways.
 
    name - sets the name of the room you are in.
    desc - places you in writing buffer to set the description of the room you
           are in.
    addroom - (houses only) Allows you to add a room to the house.
    givekey - creates a key to your house in your inventory.  Keys are your own
              responsibility. If you give a key to your home to someone,
              you give them access to all that is in your house.

~

1 HOUSING~
&GHousing is available at times throughout the Realms.  To see the currently
&Gavailable housing, type "homebuy list".
 
&GHousing provides mortals with a place to call home.  There are two different
&Gtypes of housing: apartments and houses.
 
&GHouses have the following features:
&GItems are saved that are dropped in them, as with clan storage vaults.  Up
&Gto 4 rooms may be added to the first room for a cost of 100 million per room.
Accessories may also be purchased for houses using the "accessories" command.

&GAll houses/apartments have the following features:
&GYou may change the name and description of each room.  Keys can be created
&Gfor &Ga menial charge to allow access in and out by characters and their
&Gfriends.
 
&RNOTE: &WA player that enters your house with a key will not be ejected by an
&Wimmortal. This is no different than giving a key to your own home to any one
&Wyou meet. Immortals will NOT police keys, or people that enter your home when
&Wthe door is open or with a key. &RKeys are the responsibility of the home-
&Rowner.
 
&GHomeowners may return to their home with the command "GOHOME".  This command
&Gworks in the same instances the spell 'word of recall' would work.

~

1 HOWTOIMM~
&C  The only means of attaining the first level of immortality, Neophyte, is by
being &Wsponsored by an immortal of level 53 or higher.&C We do not currently
accept applications, nor are we receptive to tells containing "I want to imm,
can you sponsor me?" It is always better for an immortal to notice your work
here on the Realms, and seek you out first.
  
  We do look for certain prerequisites. These are guidelines, not rules. 
However, they are adhered to nearly all of the time.  
  We are looking for people who have long term experience on the Realms of
Despair. We need people with solid knowledge of the game, it's ins and outs, 
and the communities that are existent.
  We need people with patience and the ability to deal with people &Wtactfully
but firmly.&C A good public image is also good to have, as you will be dealing
with problem players as soon as you are brought on staff.
  &WA prior knowledge of the SMAUG mud command system&C is beneficial. Basic 
immortal command knowledge is a valuable asset and will generally raise your
priority level. This includes everything from the admin commands to the build-
ing commands. Life is very busy as an Immortal, and &Wbeing a quick learner &Cby
listening and reading the help files on what is available is a big plus.
  A past history of &Wproven leadership abilities&C in a visible organization is a
near must. This allows us to gauge the previous &Wtrustworthiness and maturity&C
of the player.  We require a dedication to the game at large. An immortal must
be &Wunbiased&C to any organization currently in the game. An immortal character 
is a tool to use to benefit every player in the game. We need people who are
willing to make &Wlong term commitments&C to the benefit of the game.  
  We do require that your character has been &Wplayed not less than 500 hours.&C
You must be available &Wsolid amounts of time&C, and have a &Wfirm grasp of the
English language.&C

57 'HP'~
This is an abbreviation for hit points.  All classes begin with 20 hp
at creation and gain between 6 and 19 hp per gained level, depending on
class, race and CON.  Equipment can also add to your total hp.
~

1 HQS~
Peaceful players are not to enter deadly hq's.  If found there you will be 
escorted out if you don't do so voluntarily.  Non compliance will result
in punishment.
~

54 HSET~
Syntax: hset  <command> [value] [help topic]
 save                            Saves all help pages (to help.are)
 level <level> <help topic>      Sets help topic to specified level
 keyword <keyword> <help topic>  Sets help keyword to specified keyword
 remove <level.><help topic>     Removes the specified help page
 
Note:  If you wish to set more than one keyword to a help topic, enclose all
       the keywords, space separated inside quotes.  (Like in spellcasting)
Note:  If you have instances of multiple help files with the same keyname,
       using Hset Remove without a level designation will remove the one with
       the lowest level of access. ie:
 
       Help file XYZZY at level 57, and help file 'SAVE XYZZY' at level 58.
       Typing 'HSET REMOVE XYZZY' will remove the level 57 XYZZY.
       Typing 'HSET REMOVE 58.XYZZY' will remove the level 58 'SAVE XYZZY'.
 
Note:  When changing keywords, remember that syntax is:
        hset keyword (new keyword) (existing keyword)

Setting a help entry level to -1 prevents the header from showing up 
when you view the help with the help command.

0 HUMAN HUMANS~
In the beginning the gods created Humans, Elves and Ogres.  Among
them humans thrived and became the most prolific, and they remain
the most numerous and varied race in the Realms.

Humans are bipeds with upright stances, and while some are larger
the majority stand between five and a-few-inches-under six feet in
height.  There is great variance in their weight, as well as hair,
eye and skin color; it is rare to that any two look exactly alike.

Humans have no inborn predisposition to any alignment or class path.
As a highly adaptable race with no inherent strengths or weaknesses,
they are able to assume and the role of virtually any class.

In the dark time, humans were mated sometimes by choice with elves
(the half-elf), and often by force with ogres (the half-ogre), orcs
(the half-orc) and trolls (the half-troll).
 
Humans have no experience penalties or bonuses, and make their home
in the city of New Darkhaven.
 
Humans can follow the ways of the following classes:
Mage Cleric Thief Warrior Vampire Druid Ranger Augurer Paladin Nephandi

-1 ICE~
ICE - the IMC Channel Extensions protocol

ICE is a response to the cesspool-like attributes that rchat, rimm, and
even rcode have acquired over the last few months. It is IRC-ish in some
ways, but hopefully it will be used more constructively than IRC.

For a quick introduction and setup guide for ICE, see ICE-INTRO

The basic ICE structure is (greatly simplified):

. Some nodes on IMC - normally hubs - run channel daemon code that
  manages channels
. Each of these nodes maintains a list of the channels they manage, and
  the various attributes of them - who owns them, and so on
. The daemons regularly tell all muds on IMC what channels they have, and
  what their attributes are
. Based on this information, the muds on IMC decide which of their local
  users can use which ICE channels. If one mud is modified to ignore these
  restrictions, then the other muds will recognize this (since they, too,
  know the restrictions) and ignore messages from that mud.

Every channel on ICE is of the form nodename:channelname, for example a
channel called hub2:IAdmin is the channel IAdmin maintained by the node hub2.
Each mud picks which channels it is interested in (see ILIST and
ISETUP) and creates a local channel name which can be used to talk on
that channel.

Generally, any admin on a mud can create a channel on any node - although
nodes can be configured to restrict who can create channels. Whoever
creates a channel owns it, and can control who can use that channel (in
whatever way they wish). The trick, of course, is to persuade the admins
of other muds that your channel has value. Creating and modifying a
channel is done via the ICOMMAND command.

Channels can be tuned into and out of on a player-by-player basis by
using the ICHAN command.

There are a variety of ways of controlling who can hear and use a channel
- see ICE-POLICY for more information.

~

-1 ICE-INTRO~
A Quick Introduction to ICE

This assumes that the code for IMC and ICE is installed and running, and
that you have an active connection to an IMC network.

1. ILIST. This will give you a list of possible channels to choose from.
   Pick one that you want to add, that has a policy of 'open'. Note its
   name (of the form node:channel).

2. Decide what command you want to use to speak on this channel on your
   mud. This is the channel's localname.

3. Type: ISETUP ADD <node:channel> <localname>

4. You should now be able to use the channel. Others can listen to and
   speak on the channel by using ICHAN <localname>.

5. You may wish to reconfigure the default local channel settings.
   ILIST <localname> will display them; ISETUP will change them.

6. Repeat for whatever other channels you wish to have.

See also: IMC ICE ISETUP ICOMMAND ICHAN ILIST
~

-1 ICE-POLICY~
ICE Channel Policies

Channels can have one of three policies - open, closed, and private. They
also have one owner, and zero or more operators (assigned by the owner).
They also have an include and exclude list (which can specify both
individual players ['user@mud'] and entire muds ['mud']), which can be
modified by the owner and the operators.

- Open. The channel can be accessed by all muds on the network (it is a
  broadcast channel). People on the exclude list cannot use the channel,
  with the exception of people also on the invite list. This means, for
  example, if an entire mud is excluded and one player is invited, that
  player can use the channel, but the rest of the mud can't.

- Closed. The channel can be accessed by all muds on the network (it is a
  broadcast channel), but by default they will not hear or be able to use
  it. People on the invite list can use the channel, with the exception of
  people also on the exclude list.

- Private. Identical to closed, except that the channel is actually only
  physically sent to those muds that are on the invite list. This is good
  for channels specific to a small group of muds, and not of interest to
  the majority of the network.

1 ICESHIELD FIRESHIELD SHOCKSHIELD~
Iceshield conjures an encompassing shield of ice which will return the
attacks of your enemy with tongues of cold.
Syntax:  cast iceshield
 
Fireshield surrounds the caster with a wall of fire which returns your
enemies' attacks with balls of fire.
Syntax:  cast fireshield
 
Shockshield surrounds the caster with a field of electric energy which will
return your enemies' attacks with bolts of lightning.
Syntax:  cast shockshield
 * shockshield cannot be cast on others
 
 
The chances of your shields striking your opponent increase with your level,
with the odds at low levels being very low.
 
Like shields will negate each other's effects.  For example, if your enemy
has fireshield, your fireshield will counter any fireballs thrown by his,
and his will counter any fireballs thrown by yours.
~

0 ICHAN~
Syntax:  ichan               - display current ICE channel status
         ichan <localname>   - toggle an ICE channel

IChan lets you show and toggle which ICE channels you are listening
to.  Without arguments, it will show you the channels you are listening
to; with an argument, it will turn on or off that channel.

Any channels you listen to must be locally configured first - see
ISETUP. ILIST can be used to see available channels.

See also: IMC ICE ILIST ISETUP
~

0 ICOMMAND~
Syntax:          icommand <command> <channel> [<data..>]
Common commands:  create <channel>           - create a channel
                  refresh <channel>          - refresh channel data
                  list [<channel>]           - list available commands
                  destroy <channel>          - destroy a channel
                  policy <channel> <policy>  - change channel policy
                  addop <channel> <name>     - add a channel operator
                  removeop <channel> <name>  - remove an operator
                  invite <channel> <name>    - add an invited name
                  uninvite <channel> <name>  - remove an invited name
                  exclude <channel> <name>   - exclude a name
                  unexclude <channel> <name> - remove an exclusion

ICommand is used to send commands to a channel daemon elsewhere on IMC.
It directly affects the channel itself - any changes made here will
affect all muds using the channel.

Since the actual commands are interpreted by the channel daemon, not your
mud, what is available may vary. To get a list of available commands, use
icommand list <nodename> for public commands, or icommand list
<node:channel> to see what commands you have for that channel.

icommand refresh asks the daemon to refresh your mud's information for a
channel, if it ever gets out of synx. Asking for a refresh of nodename:*
will refresh all channels on that daemon.

icommand create creates a new channel, with you as the owner
icommand destroy destroys a channel. You must own the channel.

icommand policy changes the basic policy of the channel (see ICE-POLICY).
You must be the owner.

icommand addop/removeop add and remove operators from a channel. You must
be the owner, and specify the operator's full user@mud name.

icommand invite/uninvite/exclude/unexcluded modify the invite and exclude
lists for a channel. You must be the owner or an operator on the channel.
Either a full user@mud or a simple 'mud' name (no @) can be specified.
See ICE-POLICY for more details.

~

1 ICQ~
Syntax:  icq <icq>
         icq
         icq clear
 
This will set your icq number where people can see it when they
do a whois on you.  No arguments will show what it currently is
set at, clear will reset it to nothing.

0 IDEA IDEAS TYPO BUG~
Syntax: bug <message>
Syntax: idea <message>
Syntax: typo <message>

These commands will take your message and record it into a file as feedback
to the mud implementors.

This set of idea responses is going to carry back over months and even
a few years.  The file has been reviewed monthly, but not cleared, so
I am taking this chance to reply to some older ideas along with the new.
 
 
&GComment: failure messages for extra attacks (blitz, roundhouse, etc.)
&gResponse: I agree getting that blank line is frustrating, so this has been
passed on to Visionary Consortium as a project.
 
&GComment: enable people to search via the first word in someones title.
example: who 'soulblazer'. benefits would range from convenience to
excouragement for rp'ing
&gResponse: Detriments would range from partial lag to fullblown freezes.
 
&GComment: I have an idea! a grand idea tis it!... make the happy death orb
wear a happy death cowboy hat. (There were numerous requests for this).
&gResponse:  Well pardners, while the Happy Death Orb may well be the
rootinest tootinest nine player slayer this side of the Pecos, he dun need
no durn hat. (Excuse me while I go retrieve my brain.  My previous response
seems to indicate it is absent.)
 
&GComment: Check for affected_by invis/hidden after a fight,
&gResponse: There is a prompt token you can find in help prompt to help you.
 
&GComment: Social for (insert numerous types of social here).
&gResponse:  Please forward all requests for socials to Moonbeam via mudmail.
The more complete the social, the better the chance it has of being accepted.
A complete social has seven actions.  See HELP SOCIALSUBMISSION.
 
&GComment: I thihnk it would be nice and a lot more convenient if you created
a "Help" channel
&gResponse : This already exists in the form of 'Tell Herne'.
 
&GComment: I think when you use the 'equipment' command.. if there is a spot
on the eq list that is not filled it should say "Nothing" or maybe "-"
&gResponse: A fine idea which has been passed on to a coder.
 
&GComment: make me an imm, but not on this guy, i will make a nother for being 
an imm, just make me an imm, hehe, just kidding, i just like having imms, i
would mainly be player relations a socials creator. well not really, just i
would like to be an imm.

male/female/neuter, i want to see how many females are on realms compared
to males... and then, it's... well... they are just wierd...
i just wana track the amount of female mudders
&gResponse: While I applaud your sociological curiousity, and while gender
politics in contemporary online environments would surely make a fascinating
thesis, I have the feeling that it is a thin veil for 'macking' and has been
denied by Blodkai in numerous idea responses before.
 
 
&GComment: Give Kali a scythe and a cool black cloak.
&gResponse: Sweet.
 
 
&GComment: Make levelling illegal.
&gResponse: ...
 
&GComment: make gul a monkey and let kali keep him as a pet
&gResponse: I'm sure Gul and I will be happier if this arrangement does
not come to pass.
 
&GComment: (numerous requests for 'buddy' lists ala AIM or ICQ)
&gResponse: No.
 
&GComment: malkavian shoulda survived to become an order, we all know it!
&gResponse: Please, don't get them riled up.  That's all we need.
 
&GComment: cum all night, really..
&GComment: xchan
&gResponse: ...
 
&GComment: if Pixies do not frolick every day they login the turn into trolls.
&gResponse:  I will refer you to Moonbeam for this one.

&GComment: Make it legal for people to attack invaders of their hometown.
&gResponse: There was actually a suggestion made on means to dispel invaders
without pkilling in hometowns.  More details to come if it is accepted.
 
&GComment: ehhh, two rivers?  wonder what happened to it
&gResponse: It blew up.
 
&GComment: make vampire a race instead of a class?
&gResponse: If we had the whole eight years of Realms to do over, vampires
would probably be radically different.  Most likely, it would be neither race
nor class.  To try and change how vampires operate at this stage of the game 
would be far more headache than it is worth for a small degree of 'fantasy
realism'(Yes, I did just make that term up, and no, it shouldn't make sense).

&GComment: I hope I haven't suggested this one before Bring back all
the Legendary eq and pieces pieces to make them up. Like the blade of
legend for the Sword of Legend and the Suit/Armor of Legends and the 
Shield of Legend.
&gResponse: All the pieces of the Sword of Legend are still in the game,
though the Blade is difficult to obtain.  As for the other Legendary
items you have mentioned, I have never heard of them.  You might try
Dragon's Pass for the Dragon Claw of Legend, or talk to Razfellow about
his Codpiece of Ill Repute.
 
&GComment: entrance to Realm of Worship is not closed. But it's a gate, let's
put a 'gate' keyword on it instead of 'door'?
&gResponse: Done.  It also closes now to make it a touch more difficult for
new players to stumble in and meet that loveable Divine Retribution.
 
&GComment: TAX CUT!  RAISE THE ECONOMY!  BRING BACK MORE GOLD
&gResponse: We tax you?
 
&GComment: Allow players to choose height/weight during character creation
&gResponse: This has been discussed before and may be a reality some day.
 
&GComment: make danny not ANTI-thief!!! (spammed in roughly 200 times)
&gResponse: If there was any possibility of this ever changing, you can
thank Taichillo for ensuring it never does.
 
&GComment: Hugs for Barabbas
&gResponse: Hell no.
 
&GComment: I'm STILL waiting for my cuddles, and I've come up with loads of 
wonderful ideas.
&gResponse: Hell no to you too.
 
&GComment: a player should be able to use glorys to add wear prog on an item
&gResponse: While a nice idea, this is an impossibility.  Programs can only
be changed or added to an entire object number, not just an individual item.
 
&GComment: make sex possible so it's more likely to happen when you're drunk
&gResponse: Please contact Faceripper for further details on this comment.
 
&GComment: Deity of Shadows?
&gResponse: Yes?
 
&GComment: game.org should host its own guild and order sites
&gResponse: This option is available.  Contact Tical for futher details.

all these changes affect playing..and publish the goings of their chars
in the archives every day
&gResponse: If levelling areas are overcrowded already, do you really want
forty uppity people like us descending on you en masse?  Not to mention the
'journals' might get a bit frightening, especially from Stoneheft.
 
&GQuestion: where is answers3???
&gResponse: Help idearesponse, idearesponse2, idearesponse3, idearesponse4.
 
&GComment: put kali in anger management classes! :)
&gResponse: Might I say it is almost disturbing how many times I am mentioned
in these ideas?  Can't you people fixate on Herne or something?
 
&GComment: I feel strongly that you should consider an eqwipe. This would
erase all the equipment currently located on all players.  It would make the
place alot cooler, and it's much easier and more friendly than a pwipe.
Thank you. (times 37)
Comment:  Hell sucks.
&gResponse: Idea Ban the use of the idea command in Hell.
 
&GComment: (numerous requests for increased ignore slots or ignore all)
&gResponse:  I will bring this up to the other CoE, but I imagine it was
limited for a reason.  However, I will inquire.  And for those want want
ignore all, I suggest the stunning command, chan -all.
 
&YBecause a response was not written here does not mean a submitted idea was

&r*&w--------------------------------------------------------------------&r*
 
&gFor 10 glory, you can have your name added to the keyword list of any item.
This is valuable for those without enough glory to rename an item (where you
can also request this to be done, included in the cost of the rename). It
can be used to see who (or what) currently has your item, if it becomes lost
or stolen. The item is located by casting 'locate object' (name).
 
IDTagging will not be done on an item owned by another player, shown by their
name already on the item, unless that player is present, and gives permission.
A separate 10-glory charge is required to change or remove an existing name. 
 
ID Tagging doesn't grant mortals the right to demand Imms retrieve items from
other players for them.  They can request it, and Imms have every right to
refuse such a request.  ID Tagging is only provided so a mortal can know who
(or what) possesses their item.

This ifcheck only returns TRUE if the eq is actually being worn.
If the eq is in the character's inventory, that doesn't count.
 
Don't confuse this ifcheck with "ovnumwear". It works like so:
 
if ovnumwear(21061) > 3
 
It checks if the mob (the mob associated to the mob prog) has more
than 3 pieces of eq vnum 21061.
 
Ovnumwear only works on the mob associated witht the mob prog.
Wearingvnum checks a specific character - either a PC or NPC.

1 IGNORE~
Syntax:  ignore
Syntax:  ignore <character>
Syntax:  ignore reply/none
 
Ignore allows you to ignore other characters in the Realms.  All tells,
says, socials, and emotes from these characters will be blocked (gagged
out), as well as anything they may say on public channels; you will not
see anything from the person you are ignoring on public or private channels.
 
Simply typing ignore will give you a list of all the characters you are
currently ignoring.
 
Ignore <character> allows you to add or remove a character from your list
of ignored players.  If the name is already on the list it will be removed.
If the name is not on the list it will be added.  Note that only the names
of actual characters will be accepted and that it is not necessary for
them to be logged on at the time.
 
Ignore reply will cause you to ignore the last person to send you a tell.
This can be used to prevent invisible people from spamming you.
 
Ignore none will set you to ignoring no one.

1 IGQC 'INTER GUILD QUEST COUNCIL'~
The Interguild Quest Council meets every second Monday to create, 
critique and compile quests that guilds compete in on a monthly 
basis. The council is comprised of guild representatives that volunteer 
their time to allow their guild access to these monthly events. The 
purpose of the IGQC Quests is to foster greater cooperation and comraderie 
between the guilds. Though sometimes pitting guild versus guild, more 
often than not the quests bring together the skills of each class into 
teams that compete against each other.
 
Should you wish further information about the IGQC, please contact the 
Mortal co-heads &WDarshanin or Shadrack, &w or the Immortal sponsors,
&WElisabet or Korell.

51 ILIST~
Syntax:  ilist               - list all known ICE channels
         ilist <channel>     - list details on one ICE channel

IList displays information on channels active on ICE.
Without arguments, it will produce a display similar to:

Name            Local name      Owner           Policy
hub2:IAdmin     IAdmin          Nemon@AR        open
hub2:ICode      ICode                                    (inactive)
hub2:test       (not local)     Nemon@ARtest    private

This shows the canonical name (eg. hub2:IAdmin), the local name (eg IAdmin
- which can be used as an abbreviation in ISETUP, and which is also
the command to speak on that channel), the owner of the channel (eg.
Nemon@AR), and the channel's policy (see ICE-POLICY).

If a channel is not configured locally, it will have (not local) for its
local name.

If a channel is configured locally, but is not actually active on IMC, it
will have an (inactive) flag on it.

IList with a channel name will provide detailed information on that
channel. For example:

Channel hub2:IAdmin:
  Local name: IAdmin
  Format 1:   (IAdmin) %s: %s
  Format 2:   (IAdmin) %s %s
  Level:      102

  Policy:     open
  Owner:      Nemon@AR
  Operators:  Drylock@AR
  Invited:    NiceGuy@SomeMud
  Excluded:   SomeMud

This displays the channel name, local name, policy, and owner, as above. It
also displays:

- the minimum level needed on your mud to see the channel

- the format for displaying messages from the channel. These can contain
  any color codes etc. that your mud uses.

  Format1 is the string displayed when someone speaks normally on the
  channel - the first %s is replaced by their name, the second %s by what
  they say.

  Format2 is a similar string for emotes. Again the first %s is their name,
  the second %s the text of their emote.

- any operators for the channel. This can only be changed by the owner of
  the channel. Operators can modify the 'invited' and 'excluded' fields
  via the ISETUP command.

- the invited and excluded people on the channel. See ICE-POLICY for
  more details.

1 'ILL FORTUNE'~
Syntax: c 'ill fortune' <victim>
 
Ill Fortune reduces the victim's luck by three.
~

51 IMC~
IMC, or Intermud chat, is a means of talking with people across
different muds by networking many muds to one hub server.

For more information on Intermud chat, try:
RBEEP RTELL RREPLY RWHO RQUERY RCHANNELS IMCLIST
 
To post to the imc.board..go to the Darkhaven Courier and look at the
sign for more information.
~

-1 IMC~
IMC (Inter-Mud Communication) provides a way for muds to connect together and
share various services: chat channels, tells, notes, who listings, and so on.

The available mortal-level IMC commands are as follows. See the help topics
for each of these for more information.

- IMCLIST : get a list of active muds that are connected to IMC.
- RCHAT   : send a message on the common chat channel.
- RWHO    : send a who request to a mud.
- RTELL   : send a tell to someone on another mud.
- RREPLY  : reply to a rtell from someone on another mud.
- RQUERY  : ask for information of some type from another mud.
- RBEEP   : "beep" another player. Use sparingly.
- RWHOIS  : find someone on IMC
- RFINGER : get information about a player on another mud
- ISTATS  : get some (interesting?) stats about IMC.
- RCHAN   : show which channels you are listening to, and modify that state.

There is also provision for inter-mud notes/mail; see 'IMC NOTES'.

IMC2 was written by Oliver Jowett <oliver@sa-search.massey.ac.nz>, aka
Spectrum. Mail me if you're interested in connecting to the IMC network.
The source code is available at ftp://sa-search.massey.ac.nz/pub/mud/imc2/

51 'IMC CONFIG'~
The 'imc' command is used to configure your IMC setup:

Syntax:  imc add <mudname>            - add a new IMC connection entry
         imc set <...>                - set the details of an IMC connection
         imc delete <mudname>         - remove an IMC connection
         imc rename <old> <new>       - rename an IMC connection
         imc reload                   - load a new IMC config file from disk
         imc localname <name>         - set the local IMC name
         imc localport <port>         - set the local IMC port

Add, delete, and rename should be self-explanatory. The name of an IMC
connection MUST match the name which the other end is using.

Reload destroys the version of the configuration in memory, and reloads it
from disk. This is useful if you have hand-edited the config file and want
to load your changes without rebooting. 'imc reload' also reloads the
rignores file.

The set command has several forms:

imc set <mudname> all <data...>     - set all values for a mud
                  host <hostname>   - set the hostname to connect to
                  port <portnum>    - set the remote IMC port to connect to
                  clientpw <pw>     - set the case-sensitive client password
                  serverpw <pw>     - set the case-sensitive server password
                  rcvstamp <value>  - set the receivestamp
                  noforward <value> - set the noforward bitmask
                  flags <value>     - set the connection flags

The 'all' form takes a series of values:

imc set <mudname> all <host> <port> <clientpw> <serverpw> <rcvstamp>
                      <noforward> <flags>

For information on the exact details of each field, see the IMC documentation.

The localname and localport commands set the IMC name and port of -your- mud.
Use with care.

-1 'IMC NOTES'~
Notes (boards, mail, etc) are very mud-dependent, but in general, if they
have been connected to IMC, then you can simply write notes to player@mudname
in addition to normal 'player'.

For example, you may be able to do:

note to abcde@somemud anotherplayer immortal@someothermud

and the note would go to:
  abcde on the mud called 'somemud'
  anotherplayer on your mud
  all immortals on the mud called 'someothermud'

The 'playernames' used are interpreted by the mud that receives them, not
your mud, so be careful when writing notes to group names such as 'immortal'.

If your note cannot be delivered within 12 hours for some reason (if the
mud is down, does not exist, or refused your mail) then you will get a note
from the system telling you so.

51 IMCLIST~
Syntax:  imclist                  - get a list of active muds on IMC
         imclist direct           - get a list of directly connected muds
         imclist config           - see the local IMC config

'imclist' lists active muds on IMC. It lists all the muds which this mud knows
about on the IMC network, and when they were last heard from. The 'route'
section is mainly for diagnostics, and indicates the route that your mud will
send packets via to get to another mud.

'imclist direct' shows direct connections from your mud to other muds.

'imclist config' shows the local IMC configuration and state.

56 'IMM AUTH' 'IMM AUTHORIZE'~
Associated help files: authorize
 
Authorize <player> name -- This is the command used to allow a player to
  continue in the Spectral Gate pre-auth area, but will make them choose
  a new name prior to entering the Academy.  Use this command if the name
  is questionable, modern, or rude.  If the name is acceptible, but in all
  caps, accept the name, but send them a tell requesting they not use all
  caps for their name in the future.
 
Authorize <player> yes -- This is used to accept a players name.  Once this
  command is used, the player requires no further Immortal commands to enter
  the Realms.
 
Authorize <player> no -- This command is exclusively used to deny players
  with extremely rude or profane names and banned sites.  Use this command
  sparingly.
 
Levels 51-54 have primary responsibility for character authorization.  All
Immortals should periodically type 'authorize' to assure their are not any
players waiting for authorization.  The new system allows the Immortals a
bit of time to decide if an name is appropriate before accepting or denying
it.  If you are in doubts to a names acceptibilty, but it is not profane or
extremely modern, you should probably accept it.

&w1.  &gAny fake phone number a girl gave you would automatically

51 'IMM ECHO'~
Associated help files: echo

Echos should generally be medieval in nature, and their use confined
primarily to administrative functions, weddings, quest, role-playing
and the like.  Role-playing should be used rarely, however.
 
Though there is some leeway within these guidelines, some practices
are frowned upon and should be avoided.  Do not use your name in an echo
unless necessary.  Avoid comical phrases or 'cutsey' terms.  Do not use
:) or other symbols/punctuations at all.
 
If any of the above are necessary, there exist a sufficient number of
public channels via which the task can be accomplished while still
reaching a wide audience -  without forcing it onto the screen of
every character in the game.
~

51 'IMM EQUIP~
.                       Equipment Usage
                       ---------------
**  All equipment worn by an immortal must be made from vnum 1222.
**  No stats or affects may be added to vnum 1222.
**  If you need to test your mobs, you may make a weapon with the
    stats needed to test your mob.
~

51 'IMM FORCE'~
Associated help files: force
 
This command allows you to make someone execute a command.  Forcing
someone can often be looked at as high-handed.  Most common use of
force is to make someone do something as you are snooping, to check
problems or bugs, without waiting having to tell the character exactly
what to type.  It is always best to ask the person before you begin
forcing them.  You may also use force to make a player quit, drop,
or read something when you are punishing them.  
 
Force all <command> can be done, but causes excessive lag because it
causes every player lower than you to attempt the command.  This should
be reserved to "force all save" in times of numerous crashes.  You should
never force all to use a channel.
~

55 'IMM FORCECLOSE'~
Associated help files: forceclose
 
This command will force a certain descriptor to close.  To use, you
must first look for the number listed under Desc on the user list.
Then type: forceclose <Desc #>
 
You can use forceclose to knock a trouble player offline, as well as
knock off someone who it stuck online.
~

58 'IMM FREEZE'~
Associated help files: help freeze
 
Syntax: deny         <character>
Syntax: disconnect   <character>
Syntax: freeze       <character>
 
DENY denies access to a particular player and throws them out of the game.  
Deny is permanent (persists across reboots) and is not undoable from within
the game.  Only someone with access to the player files directory may repeal
a DENY by editing the appropriate player file.
 
DISCONNECT <character> immediately disconnects that character.
 
FREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any
commands at all.
~

51 'IMM GOTO'~
Syntax: goto <name>

This is a reminder to use common courtesy when using such commands
as goto.   Not only is it considered inappropriate to goto higher
level immortals without asking permission, the same could be said
when wanting to visit any player on the mud.  A quick tell requesting
to visit would suffice.  For those of you who frequent headquarters,
either Clans, Guilds or Orders, requesting permission, though not
necessary, is certainly welcome.  Note that if a mortal requests that
you leave their hq, and you have no pressing business, you are obligated
to abide by their wishes.  (This does not apply to high ranking immortals.)
 
~

2 IMM IMMORTAL~
An Immortal is a player who has proven his/herself as a valuable
asset to the Realms.  These players are those that you will see as
level 51 and higher. To get a current list of immortals online you 
would use who imm or who 51. You can also obtain a list of all immortals
by typing wizlist. 
 
Immortals are the administrative backbone of the realms. They also
aid in quest creation for mortals, new idea submissions, new
area additions/changes and coding additions/changes.

51 'IMM INVIS'~
Associated help files: invis and wizinvis
 
Those Immortals between levels 51 and 54 may invis to level 51 when they
are running or preparing a quest, involved in building projects that
require you to be uninterrupted, or you are actively watching a mortal.
At all other times, the Immortal should be visible to all levels of mortals
and Immortals.  Wizinvis is to be used as a tool to assist you in your duties
as an Immortal, it is not a means to spy on others or hide.
 
Immortals of level 55 and above may use wizinvis beyond 51 to work on
projects or monitor another person.  It is mandatory to be visible to all
other immortals whenever reasonably able to do so.  Keep the use of
"Someone" to a minimum on channels.  Exceptions are when you need to answer
a question, make a comment, or pass on some information, but are too busy
to become visible.

51 'IMM ORDER' IMMORDER~
.
&WPolicy on Immortals in Orders:
 
&YImmortals may be members of orders when they have achieved level
53 or above.  No Immortals still within Neophyte Council jurisdiction,
(51, 52) are to be inducted into orders.  Orders may have 3 immortal
members, the deity counting as one, plus two additional.  If an 
immortal under level 53 is in an order, they will be removed until
they have reached level 53.
~

52 'IMM RECHO'~
Associated help files: recho
 
Rechos should generally be medieval in nature, and their use confined
primarily to administrative functions, weddings, quest, role-playing
and the like.  Recho can be seen by all players in one room.  Do not 
use recho to "scare" mortals.  Recho is seen on logs, be cautious in
using them in social/private situations.
~

55 'IMM SNOOP'~
Associated help files: snoop

The snoop command is a very valuable tool, when used appropriately.  Snoop
not only allows you to watch another person, but to see the world through
their eyes, helping to track down problems the person may be experiencing.
The reasons for snooping are too varied to mention here, but the reasons
NOT to snoop are easily listed.
 
-- Do not snoop people being intimate. <i.e. Mudsex, voyeurism, etc...>
-- Do not repeat information learned in snoop casually, especially to mortals
-- Only snoop a person talking to a higher level Immortal with the higher
   Immortals "Express Permission".
-- If a higher level Immortal begins communication with someone you are
   snooping, inform that higher Immortal immediately of the snoop.
-- If a higher level Immortals requests you to stop snooping, do so quickly.
-- "Spot check" snooping of lower level Immortals is part of being a higher
   level immortal.  All Immortals may be snooped at any time, for any reason.
-- Do not snoop for the purpose of gaining information for personal reasons.
-- Any incidental references learned in snoop should be disregarded.
    ** For example, you learn someone is having a mud affair from snoop.
    ** This information has nothing to do with the reason you are snooping
    ** and should not affect your judgement.  It should not be passed on.
-- Being an Immortal is a privilege and a job.  Snoop is a tool to assist
   you do your job properly.  Snoop is neither a toy nor a right.

1 'IMM SPONSORSHIP'~
The immortal sponsorship process is as follows :
 
A. An immortal of 53 or higher will approach you and discuss with you why they
   think you should be an immortal
B. If you agree to be sponsored to imm, the sponsoring immortal will post a
   note to the immortal community to be reviewed.  
   - The reviewing process can take anywhere from two weeks, to several months
     based on the needs of the immortal community.
   - During this time, it is ill-advised to ask about your status or "brag"
     about the fact you are under sponsorship. This has been known to only
     cause problems, and incessant tells asking about your status will reflect
     badly on yourself.
   - During this time immortals will likely appear occasionally to meet with 
     you and discuss your sponsorship with you. Not all of the immortals will
     likely be familiar with you and this allows them a chance to gauge your
     personality and abilities.
C. After sufficient review of your sponsorship:
  1. If you are accepted, you will be placed in line to become an immortal.
     You will not be told you have been accepted until we are ready to bring
     you aboard the staff. The time period from acceptance to immortalizing is
     based on the needs of the MUD.
  2. If you are not accepted, you will be contacted as soon as possible and
     informed of it, as well as the reasons that we can discuss.
 
  - Either way, this information will likely come from the ranking immortal of
    The Symposium.
~

54 IMMCONNECT~
To create items that connect, follow these steps:
 
1. Determine the number of objects you will be connecting.
2. Create each object.  Only the final object should be wearable with stats.
3. Make each piece item type "piece".
4. Item values for each item work like this:
 
        Value0 = Previous item vnum
    Value1 = Next item vnum
    Value2 = Final Obj vnum
 
For example, if you want to make a staff from two separate items. These items
could be ovnum 100 and ovnum 101. "Connected", these items make ovnum 102
 
ovnum 100 can have a v0 of 0, v1 of 101, and v2 of 102
ovnum 101 can have a v0 of 100, v1 of 0, and v2 of 102
 
When you "Connect" items 100 and 101, you will get item 102.
~

51 IMMCOUNCIL~
Once an Immortal has reached level 53, they may wish to join one of the many
Councils. This is a perfect way for an Immortal to find their 'niche' and
contribute to a specialized area of the game which interests them most.
There are several Councils an Immortal may belong to (Type:  Councils  - to
get more information on these). The current policy on an Immortal joining a
Council is as follows:
 
  - At level 53, you are free to inquire with the Council Head about becoming
    part of that Council. The Council Head will have the information specific
    to that Council and the process involved in joining.
 
  - Below level 53, an Immortal can only belong to a Council if there is a need
    for their services and their Mentor approves of the choice. This is only
    done in rare cases and requires CoE approval, as well.

51 IMMQUEST~
This help file will contain the current status as well as the expectations of
what is to be followed of Immortals questing.
  Currently imms &YARE&G allowed to quest.
 
&WRules for imm's questing:&G
 
 &W*&G It is expected that no Imm will be multi-playing their imm while they
   are questing.  This includes multi-playing while invis/afk/etc.
 
 &W*&G It is expected that no imm will log off their imm character in order to
   quest.  We don't want the situation arising where everyone logs off and the
   QC imm is stranded running the quest and fielding everything else.
 
 &W*&G You may &CNOT&G quest if you log in with your imm at any time during
   the quest.
 
&WSo when can you quest?&G
 
 &W*&G It's somewhat limiting, but you can quest &CIF&G you happen to be 
   morting when a quest begins, &COR&G if you are given the explicit
   permission of the imm running the quest. &CPlease do not pressure them.&G
 
 
Immortals level 52 or higher may receive a rename scroll or twenty glory once
a month. It is important that Lascivias have the name of the mortal you wish
to have this glory given to, the mortals are loaded once a month and given
the glory. This program of receiving 'payment' once a month is a great big
gift from the CoE and should always be considered in the 'probationary'
stages. Meaning: If the fact that immortals receive glory for being immortal
becomes a point of contention in the game, it will be removed to quell any
preconceived notions that immortals are shown favoritism.

51 IMM_CR1 IMM_BODYBAG1~
&G - You are never required to do a CR

- If you do perform an CR you are required to take at least one
  item as charge, and this item should be one of the best items
  the player has.  You have some discretion on exactly what you
  take, but it should be an item of value
  &Y**Exceptions:&G
    - the player is under level 10
    - you are running a quest and the char died in that quest
    - you have approval from a CoE member
 
- If you wish, you may inform the player of what you intend to
  take as a price for the CR before actually bodybagging them.
  This should not open the door to bargaining, you can simply
  give them the option of agreeing.  You do not _have_ to
  inform the mortal of the cost unless you intend to extract
  more than the usual price (more than one item)

- Players should have made some attempt at retrieving their
  own corpse before being given a CR.

- Corpses should be at least "crawling with vermin" prior to being
  bodybagged (a corpse timer of less than 20)
 
- You may not give free or discounted CRs to your friends except
  in the case of play-testing something you are working on
 
- You may not CR deadly characters except when they are involved
  in a quest and died as a result of that quest
 
- Use the 'bodybag' command to see the player's favor.  If they
  have enough favor they must supplicate their corpse
 
- You may not CR your own mortal unless _all_ the following apply
  (Again with the obvious except of play-testing):
   - there is no other Immortal online to do it for you
   - you have tried to get your corpse on your own the same way
     mortals must
   - your corpse is in "the last stages of decay", meaning you
     cannot wait any longer, i.e. a corpse timer of less than 8
 
&GContinued in:  &YIMM_CR2
~

51 IMM_CR2 IMM_BODYBAG2~
&G- If you perform a CR for one of your own mortal characters, you
  must take (and eat) at least one of the best items from your
  mortal.  Please also post a note on 1220.  Players can and do
  sometimes file complaints about these things, and it's better
  if we have an idea what's going on.
 
The prime directive for bodybagging/corpse retrievals is that these
are privileges - they are not rights, facts of life or givens for
players.  It may be a common function for immortals to perform, and
its frequency has over time crept upward, but do not confuse that
with being an integral or necessary part of the game.  With the
advent of deities and the ability to supplicate corpses, bodybagging
should be less frequent than in the past.

1 'INDIGNATION'~
Syntax: cast indignation
 
This spell fills the members of the caster's group with the Fury of
The High Gods, causing them to fight more effectively.  INDIGNATION
improves not only the likelihood of hitting targets, but the damage
done when a hit is made.  
 
The Fury of The High Gods is an enormous burden to carry, hence the
spells duration is relatively brief.

This is only a brief list of commands that will help you do things with your
character.  More detailed information on each command can be found in the
HELP files.  You may also read sections 1 and 20 in your Adventurer's Guide
book to learn more about these commands.
~

1 INFRAVISION INFRARED~
Syntax:  c infravision
Syntax:  c infravision <character>
 
This spell enables the character to detect the heat signatures of other
players and creatures in the room with them.  This spell will also allow
you to find items in corpses, containers, etc. but will not allow you to
view the actual contents.
 
You must have a light source to actually see items, room descriptions,
the contents of corpses or containers, room exits and the like inside
a darkened area.
 
Infravision is not the same as "night vision".
~

0 'INNER WARMTH' INNER WARMTH~
syntax: c inner (character)
This spell makes you more resistant to all forms of coldness.
~

59 INSTALLAREA~
Syntax: installarea <area filename> <full area name/title>

Installs a prototype area into the mud as a non-prototype area.
The filename can be fixed with aset, (don't forget to foldarea the new name.)

Currently the builder should quit and have his/her vnums cleared manually.
(This should be fixed soon).
~

58 INSTAROOM~
&YSyntax&W:  instaroom
 
This command will set the resets for the room you are in to the
exact parameters which are in the room. Be sure not to leave odd
objects, such as spilled blood, corpses, or remnants on the ground
at the time when you perform an instaroom.
 
&YSee also&W: RESET, RESETCMDS and INSTAZONE.
~

54 INSTAZONE~
Syntax: instazone [nodoors]

This command lets your instantly create a whole set of resets for your area
based on all the mobiles and objects contained within your area.
All you have to do is place each mob in its proper room, wearing what it
should be wearing, carrying what it should be carrying, and objects in their
proper places, or in their proper containers, and doors in their proper
states, (open, closed, locked).  The instazone command will clear out your
current resets (if any), and create new ones for you.
You may optionally specify "nodoors" so that door resets will not be
created.

NOTE:  This command will wipe out any existing resets!  Do not use this
command after you have added your own resets with 'reset add'.
The recommended procedure is to use instazone, then use the 'reset' command
to add any special resets, and NOT use instazone again.

See RESET and RESETCMDS.
~

1 INT INTELLIGENCE~
Intelligence (INT in your 'score') represents your character's mental
capacity.  Among other things, it affects:
 
 - heavily influences the amount of mana a character gains at level
 
 - affects the amount of mana regenerated or recovered at each tick
   if a character is resting or sleeping
 
 - the rate at which a character learns a new skill or spell
 
 - the percentage rate at which a character practices a new language
 
Intelligence is an important factor in learning between combatants.  If
a character fights a creature several times, the more intelligent of the
two opponents will gain an advantage over time...
 
Intelligence is the prime attribute of the mage and nephandi.
 
~

0 INVIS 'MASS INVIS'~
Syntax: cast invis <character>
Syntax: cast 'mass invis'

The INVIS spell makes the target character invisible.  Invisible characters
will become visible when they attack.

      &W2.&g  Every order is expected to prepare a quest for                   
      submission _at least_ 2 weeks prior to their deadline to                 
      allow enough time for implementation and further development

      &W4.&g  Order members may not participate in an IOQC quest when          
      they are hosting the event.  Each member is encouraged to             
      provide input into the creation process and it would be              
      self-defeating to have them also participate in the actual            
      quest.

      &W7.&g  Orders may be disqualified for the following reasons:   
      Cheating on a quest, enlisting outside help, kill stealing  
      (if not permitted), using any character not specified at the
      start of each quest, and multi-ing.

52 IPCOMPARE~
Syntax: ipcompare <name>
        ipcompare <site>
        ipcompare <name or site> <room|area|world> <#>
        ipcompare pkill
        ipcompare total
 
This takes * as a wild card.
Ipcompare will compare online users to search for multiplayers. A positive
match using ipcompare does not always mean it is a multiplayer..but shows
that there are more than one user from a site on simultaneously.
Ipcompare <field> <#> will limit the output to x number of lines based on #.
* may be used as a wild card, for example ipcompare 207.18.3.* will return
matches from any that begin with the ip prior to the asterisk.
Ipcompare <field> <room|area|world> will limit the search based on that
criteria.  The room|area|world limitation will be judged on the room that
the immortal issued the command in.  So if you are in a different area
than the victim, it will show only players matching the site in the area
you are in.
ipcompare pkill - will show any multiplaying deadlies online and
ipcompare total - will give you the total number of unique ip addresses
    on the game.

51 ISETUP~
Syntax: isetup add <ice-channel> <localname>   - add a channel
        isetup delete <localname>              - delete a channel
        isetup rename <oldname> <newname>      - rename a channel
        isetup format1 <localname> <format>    - change format1 on a channel
        isetup format2 <localname> <format>    - change format2 on a channel
        isetup level <localname> <level>       - set channel level

ISetup allows you to change the local configuration of an ICE
channel. None of these commands have a lasting effect on the channel's
configuration on other muds.

ISetup add begins the configuration of a channel. It connects the
specified ice-channel (of the form nodename:channelname) to a local name.
For example: isetup add hub2:IAdmin IAdmin. The local name is also the
command used to speak on the channel.

When the channel is added, various default values are filled in for
format1, format2, and level.

ISetup delete removes this link. It does not affect the channel itself;
it just deletes the local configuration link for the channel.

ISetup rename changes the local name of a channel. It does not affect the
channel name itself for other muds - just the command used locally to
access it.

ISetup format1 and format2 change how a channel is displayed locally.
Each format string must have exactly two %s's within it (this is checked
for) - the first will be replaced by the speaker's name, the second by
whatever they say. Format1 is used for normal speech, format2 for emotes.
See ILIST for more information.

ISetup level sets the minimum level necessary on your mud to hear or use
the channel.

51 ISTATS~
Syntax:  istats                     - display use(less?) statistics

mud is generating due to IMC.

2 KILLER KILLERFLAG KILLERFLAGS~
&WThe mud will automatically assign you a &PKiller &Wflag if you cause the
death of another player. Only situations which involve peacefuls being
killed by mortals, or &RDeadlies &Wkilling fellow clanmembers will result
in the assignment of this flag. You will receive a &PKiller &Wflag if:
 
  1. You caused the DEATH of another player, regardless of who attacked first.
  To help prevent yourself from acquiring a &PKiller &Wflag after being
  attacked, set yourself to &YConfig +Nice &W(See &CHelp Config &Wfor info).
 
  2. You were the Master of a mobile which killed another player while
  under the influence of your charm. PLEASE NOTE that you will receive a
  &PKiller &Wflag even if the player that died attacked the charmed
  mobile without the Master's permission. Charmers and Pet Owners are held
  responsible for the actions of their Pets/Charmies. (See &CHelp Charm

1 KILLSTEAL KILLSTEALING~
Don't do it.
 
Kill stealing most commonly occurs when a player attacks a mob that is
already engaged in combat with another player. Aside from this being
highly annoying, it is quite illegal. If someone should do this to you,
please inform them of the rules (help killsteal). Should the problem
persist, seek an immortal for assistance. Under no circumstances should
you take the law into your own hands.
 
Kill stealing can also occur when a player attacks a mob which someone else
is already in the room preparing to kill. Whereas this is not technically
stealing a kill, it is quite inconsiderate to the other players in the game.
Should someone do this to you consistantly, seek immortal assistance on the
matter. Again, never resort to taking the law into your own hands.
Please exhibit courtesy at all times, and be considerate of players who are
previously in the rooms of mobs you wish to attack. It is never a bad thing
to go the extra mile and make sure nobody is intending on killing the mob.

0 KING 'KING CASTLE' 'KINGS CASTLE' 'THE KING CASTLE' 'THE KINGS CASTLE'~
Recommended level range: 25 - 40
 
The castle of Good King Welmar was built ages ago near the city of Thalos. 
Upon the city's destruction, it lay empty for many years, many claiming it 
was cursed along with Thalos. However, when our King Welmar united the five 
great cities and thus created hope in the battle against Darkness, he found 
himself without a keep. Risking death, he and his troups crossed through the 
ruins of Thalos, eventually reaching the magnificent, impregnable fortress. 
The castle now stands as a tribute to honor, good and law.
~

1 'KINGDOM OF JUARGAN'~
Recommended level range: 10 - 25

The mighty dwarven Kingdom of Juargan was once a powerful influence
in the battle against Darkness. Sealed within their impregnable city,
any attack against them was scoffed at. However, one day centuries
ago, the great mountain kingdom sealed its gates and refused to
communicate with any of the other races. The reason for their desertion
is still unknown, but many have found hidden entrances into their vast
underground complex.

1 KNEE~
Syntax:  knee
 
A well aimed knee to your opponents midsection could effectively cripple 
them. This skill is somewhat effective in slowing down the primary
opponent and inflicting damage to them. NOTE: This skill may be used to
start fights so should not be used on your fellow players unless under
pkill conditions. This skill should not be confused with the 'kneel' 
social.

1 'KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND' KOTR~
Recommended Level Range: 35 - 50

Forged from the bloods of war and encased in powerful magiks, the great
castle of Camelot lies buried deep in the mountainous regions of the north.
Many generations of kings have ruled here, their legendary deeds etched into
the stronghold. Through the many years, law has been the binding that held
Camelot through the worst of times. The Sword of Might, Excalibur, has served
each ruler in his dominance over other men. And to each king there was a great
queen who kept her liege together through the harshest of times.
 
However, it now seems that this magnificent hierarchy of order has fallen to
chaos. King Arthur, current ruler of Camelot, and son to Uther Pendragon, lies
near death upon his throne. He has lost his queen, his sword, and his love
of the land. His bastard son, Mordred, has risen to claim kingship, but he
would surely drive it into ruin. The great knights who once served the king
wander the land, lost in their search for a holy artifact to save Arthur.
Once gentle and soaked in beauty, the grandeur of Camelot has become obscured
by darkness and despair. Only the truths of law and order could restore this
blackened land to its former glory and status.

1 KONTAUR~
Recommended level range:  25 - 50
 
 
Among the most corrupt of the lands of Despair, is Kontaur, which lies
south of the Old Marsh. Once a lush forest filled with wild vegetation
and beautiful sylvan and elven races, it is now the heart of evil in the
southern lands. The cause of the land's devastation is not completely
known. Sages believe that either Laschte or Vl'arescht opened a gate to
a race of astral travelers known as the Carnifex, which brought legions
of balrogs to Despair long ago. The balrogs waged war against all sentient
races, seeking to destroy at the leisure of their masters. The avatars of
Darkhaven were truly oppressed and fought for their very lives against
this evil army. After years of war, the Carnifex were finally driven across
the Pits of Banishment and into a legendary castle from which they could not
escape. Without their masters' guidance, the balrogs lost their edge and
began losing the war. They retreated to Kontaur, the first realm they had
conquered, and erected a castle. Although there have been many attempts to
destroy the Balrog race, none have succeeded. Many new races have come to
the forests of Kontaur recently, and made the Realms even more perilous.
Foul pixie that were corrupted by Laschte, savage beastmen and, Vl'arescht's
creation, the moblins, all guard the paths to and from the Kontaur castle.
Yet there lies a shining hope in this foul land, for A'enaar lifted her
hand and protected a tribe of forest elves known as the Misinkii.

1 'LA CHUTE D'EAU DE L'ANCIENTS' LA CHUTE~
Thus spoke the wizened mambo, hidden in her cave...
 
I can tell you of many wonders of the world, m'enfant.  Sit, leave the
world at hand for a few moments, and I will tell you of an age long gone
 
In time forgotten the great spirits set the task unto the lesser spirits to
craft and forge the world.  In time, the lessers saw the power they wielded
and rebelled.  A terrible war shook the heavens and the lessers were cast out.
One of these, Danbala ... "Le Bon Dieu", held all the waters of the earth
inside his serpentine form.  The movement of his seven thousand coils formed
formed the hills and valleys, lit the fire in the stars and set the planets
in the heavens.  He forged metals from heat and sent forth lightning bolts to
form the sacred rocks and stones.  In the light of the sun, he shed his skin
and released the water inside his serpentine body over the land.  The sun
shone in the water and created the rainbow.  Danbala loved the rainbow and made
her his wife, Aido.
Great was the evil that seperated them from one another.  But legend says the
serpent and the rainbow will meet again, and on that day they will bear the
world a great new good.
 
Some say they have seen the outcast, mon ami, and who is to say they are wrong?
 
Come, I can see my story has shaken you, sit near the fire and imagine the ages
as the moment passes...

1 'LAND OF THE FIRE NEWTS'~
Recommended level range: 5 - 20

The Land of the Fire Newts lies beneath a portion of Moria known as the
obsidian hills. This strange race is very secretive, attacking all
who intrude upon their home. Due to their reclusiveness, it has never
been known how they came to be or what their true goals are. Also, as they
remain neutral in the battle between Light and Darkness, none have ever
made an attempt to exterminate them.

51 LASOMBRA~
"An excellent decision.  I applaud.  Did you actually manage to reach it all
by yourself?"
 
     Elegant yet predatory, the Lasombra honestly think of themselves as the
apex of Cainite existence.  Firm believers in Divine Right and the rule of
the superior, they have little patience, though often much pity, for those
Cainites who are (through no fault of their own) inferior.
     The Lasombra character is a curious mix of noblesse oblige and healthy
contempt.  They actively seek power wherever is may be found, from the halls
of the cloisters to the corridors of palaces, yet they do not seek the titles
and glory that come along with rule.  Instead of chasing command for its own
sake, Lasombra take the reins of power out of a firm belief that no one can
hold them better.  The appearance of power is unimportant; what matters is
that the decisions are being made by those most suited to make them.  Indeed,
most Lasombra prefer the role of kingmaker to the title of king.
     Hand in hand with this determination to be the final arbiters of all
decisions comes a healthy contempt for those who the Lasombra feel are
inferior to them in mind, body or breeding.  In essence this means the rest
of Cainite society, and while some of the various clans have been accorded a
modicum of respect, there are none the Lasombra will acknowledge as equals.
A Lasombra will work with other Cainites, and even go so far as to consider
members of other clans to be friends, but one will never, ever consider a
member of another clan to be an equal.
     Unfortunately, there are those Lasombra whose delight in the great game
of politics blinds them to all but the game itself.  Master manipulators,
these Cainites view all of the Realms as but a chessboard that they and their
opponents play upon, the fall of kingdoms being only abstract interest to
them.  It is these Lasombra whom the other clans fear most, and their talents
and tastes have been attributed to the clan as a whole.

-1 'LAW ASSIST'~
.
&GA non-deadly may give, sell or trade scrolls, potions and equipment
with a deadly character.
 
A non-deadly character may spy for a deadly character.
 
A non-deadly may _not_ shield, heal, summon, help, hinder, portal or
otherwise assist a deadly character (this includes charm).
 
~

-1 'LAW CHANNELS'~
.
&GSpam (repeating the same message repeatedly or otherwise purposely causing
the screen to scroll), harassment (including sexual) and abusive behavior are
not permitted on any channel (this includes in 'say' or 'tell').  Do not
continue to 'tell' to someone after they have asked you to stop.
 
Profanity is not permitted on any public channel, which is a channel seen by
those other than yourself and the person to whom you are speaking.  If you
use profanity in a private conversation and the other party asks you to stop,
please respect their wishes.  The difference between '****, I'm having a bad
day' and 'what is your ****** problem' should be obvious to everyone.
 
If any level of Immortal asks you to desist on a subject, or to move the
subject to an appropriate channel, do so immediately.  Continuing on a
subject or channel after you are requested to stop may result in your
character losing its access to channels through silencing.  An Immortal's
decision on subject matter and/or channel use should be obeyed.
 
&WWarning:  &GArguing with or flaming immortals on channels _will_ get you
silenced or worse, and this may extend to your other characters as well if
you push the matter.  The Realms provides ample avenue for complaint without
resorting to public baiting and name-calling.

-1 'LAW CHARM'~
.
&GDo not bring aggressive mobs into or near Darkhaven, as when their charm
wears off (either naturally or by attack) their aggressive nature will
return.  Also do not bring aggressive mobs into areas which are lower in
level than the area from which the mob originally came.  You can use the
'areas' command to check an area's level.  See 'help charm' for more.
 
Remember, you are responsible for any action a charmed mob makes. This means
that if your mob attacks someone, you'll be labelled an attacker. It also 
means that if your mobs are spamming others, you will be liable under spam
laws.

-1 'LAW CHEATING'~
&GCheating is a very serious offense and subjects _all_ characters involved
to a slay, purge (loss of all equipment), freeze, balzhur (destruction of
all equipment and public demotion to level 2), deny or even a site ban.
 
What is considered cheating?
 - exploiting (intentionally using) a bug to gain equipment or gold
 - intentionally causing the system to crash
 - intentionally duplicating equipment or gold
 - knowingly accepting illegal equipment (see above) from others
 - attempting to duplicate equipment or gold -- * even if not successful *
 - using or making profit from equipment that was accidentally duplicated
 - using gold that was accidentally duplicated
 
Cheating hurts the game, and every player in the game.  Protect yourself
and report any bugs you find, and inform the Immortals if you have strong
cause to believe someone is engaged in any of the above. 
 
If you find you have accidentally duplicated an item, turn the item over
_immediately_ to an Immortal or drop and sacrifice the item.

-1 'LAW HARASSMENT'~
.
&GHarassment is giving a person unwanted attention, whether you perceive it
as negative or positive attention.  If a person is made to be uncomfortable
by your attention or comments, you are harassing that person.  If a person
asks you to desist in talking to them or performing socials on them, and
you do not stop, you are harassing that person.  If you act in an intimate
manner to a character, without their permission, you are harassing that
person.
 
No form of harassment is tolerated in the Realms.  We especially frown upon
unwanted comments or actions with a sexual nature or explicit content.  If
you do not have an intimate relationship with the person, whether in real
life or within the Realms, you should refrain from using suggestive actions
and/or comments.
 
If you are caught harassing another player in any way, you can be silenced,
helled, frozen, denied, and/or site banned.  Harassing another player is a
serious violation of the rules and will not be permitted.  If you choose
to harass an immortal, you will simply be deleted.
 
~

-1 'LAW KILLSTEAL'~
Don't do it.
 
Kill stealing most commonly occurs when a player attacks a mob that is
already engaged in combat with another player. Aside from this being
highly annoying, it is quite illegal. If someone should do this to you,
please inform them of the rules (help killsteal). Should the problem
persist, seek an immortal for assistance. Under no circumstances should
you take the law into your own hands.
 
Kill stealing can also occur when a player attacks a mob which someone else
is already in the room preparing to kill. Whereas this is not technically
stealing a kill, it is quite inconsiderate to the other players in the game.
Should someone do this to you consistantly, seek immortal assistance on the
matter. Again, never resort to taking the law into your own hands.
 
Please exhibit courtesy at all times, and be considerate of players who are
previously in the rooms of mobs you wish to attack. It is never a bad thing
to go the extra mile and make sure nobody is intending on killing the mob.
~

-1 LAW LAWS~
.
&GThe Realms are governed by a set of laws, most of which are simple common
sense and courtesy, and all of which must be followed to ensure everyone
the opportunity to enjoy the game.  As with any mud, a player's presence
here is a privilege, not a right, and is something we reserve the right
to deny at any time at our discretion.
 
The Immortals of the Realms are responsible for enforcing these laws, and
their decisions in these matters should be abided. If you feel an Immortal
has treated you unfairly, you may petition directly to The Panel
by emailing a note to theinquisition@game.org (see: help appeals).
 
The decisions of a God or higher are final.  To see which Immortals are
online and visible, type "who 51" at any time.
 
To read the laws, type "laws <topic>" for any of the following:

59 'LAW LAWS'~
~

1 'LAW MOBASSIST'~
A player attacking a mobile or being attacked by an aggressive mobile,
is entitled to do combat with the mobile as it was originally designed.
 
You may_not_cast any helpful or shielding spells on mobiles, whether
they are currently engaged in battle with other players or will engage
in combat with other  players at some time in the future.
 
In addition, mobiles with specific functions, like Hometown guards, are
equipped to do their job, without the assistance of players, and should
not be assisted by way of helpful or shielding spells.
~

64 'LAW MULTIPLAY'~
~

-1 'LAW MULTIPLAYING'~
.
&G
Multi-playing up to 8 characters is permitted, with the following rules:
 
 - you may only have one character link-live if it is a deadly character
   (if it appears under the "who deadly" section of the who list).  You may
   have more than one character online as long as none of your characters
   are listed under the "who deadly" section of the who list.
 
 - using multiple characters to spam any player or channel via making all
   characters say/tell/chat/avtalk a same message or series of messages
   is highly frowned upon and may earn each character a silence.
 
 - using multiple connections to avoid multi limits is strictly prohibited.
   any violation of this rule will result in the harshest of punishment.
 
&WNOTE: &GLink-dead characters are not considered to be "online."
 
&WWARNING: &GAnyone violating the 8 character limit faces punishment up to
and including immediate deletion of any characters logged at the time.
~

-1 'LAW MURDER'~
.
&GPlayer killing is decided the instant you cast any hostile spell or make
any aggressive action against a non-deadly player.  Actually killing the
target means little.  The only form of player killing allowed is between
players whose names appear on "who deadly" section of the who list.  A
battle between non-deadly characters is still illegal even if those who
are involved have agreed to the combat.
 
Being involved in an illegal pkill is a serious violation of law, and can
result in a stay in hell, slay, loss of all equipment, freeze and/or deny
or site ban. 
 
~

-1 'LAW OBJECTS'~
.
&GIf you notice an item on the ground and there is a player in the room with
it, do _not_ pick it up without first getting permission from the person<s>
in the room.  Taking such items may be considered stealing if you do not
first obtain permission from those present.
 
Do not simply take an item to identify it without asking permission.  If
you are asked to drop an item you picked up, do so immediately.
 
Do not take items laying next to a corpse, even if no one is present,
without asking the owner of the corpse if the item(s) belong to them.
 
Do not take items from a mob corpse unless you made the kill yourself or
you have specific permission from the character who made the kill.  This
includes removing gold from a corpse.
 
* &WWarning:&G  It is never wise to leave items or containers unattended and
  expect them to be there when you return.  If there is an item on the
  ground and there is neither a corpse nor a player in the room, the
  object is considered abandoned and free for the taking.
 
~

-1 'LAW PKILL'~
.
&GDeadly Characters are those which appear on the who list under the section
titled "Deadly Characters" (type 'who deadly').  A character must be level
5 _and_ 18 years of age to officially become deadly; if you are a pkill
character who doesn't fill these criteria yet, you will not appear under
'who deadly' and are _not_ yet able to pkill.
 
Deadly characters may &Wnot&G:
 a) multi-play while using a deadly character, this includes both peaceful
    and deadly characters
 b) be shared
 c) receive help (healing, shielding, portaling, etc.) from non-deadlies
 d) receive Immortal corpse retrievals or reimbursements - no exceptions
 e) attack players more than 5 levels outside their own
    - includes picking up disarmed weapons from someone outside your range
    - includes healing a fighting character outside your range
    - includes looting the corpse of someone outside your level range
 f) use mobs to either pkill players outside of the 5 level range
    or to overcome the 5 minute timer. 
 
Deadly characters &Ware &Gallowed to:
 a) pkill another player who appears on the deadly
    list (who deadly) who is within 5 levels of their own.
 b) loot the corpse of the fallen deadly player, provided they were
    the tank or dealt the killing blow.
 
&YWarning&G:  Going AFK or link-dead in a non-safe area leaves you open to
attack; a deadly is open to attack every second online, link-live or not.
~

-1 'LAW SHARING'~
.
&GCharacter sharing (when allowed) is always done at the risk of the players
involved.  Immortals will &Wnot&G recover any character lost to trading or
sharing.  Whoever owns the password owns the character.
 
A character may &Wnot&G be shared if:
 - the character is a deadly character
 - the character holds any leadership position in a Guild or Order
 
~

-1 'LAW SPAM'~
No, we are not talking about a luncheon meat here.  Spam is the repeated use
of a phrase, command, or channel that causes screen scroll for others.  Not
only is spam considered rude, but excessive screen scroll can interfere with
the game play of anyone seeing it (not to mention combat situations).  The
game will also tell you to PUT A LID ON IT and force-quit you after the 20th
repeat of a single command
 
It is also considered spam to use the same phrase over several different
channels.  The use of all-caps can also be considered spam.  Only use
capitals to add emphasis to key words in a sentence.
 
Moving a large number of items into and out of a container in a crowded, 
non-store room is considered spam.  Using multiple characters to chat the
same message at the same time is considered spam.  Making charmed mobs
or pets to cause screen scroll through movement or orders is considered
spam. ANYTHING that causes excessive or irritating screen scroll can be
considered spam.
 
Also, if you are having a conversation with another person, please try 
and limit it to tells rather than having a one on one conversation over
a public channel.
~

-1 'LAW STAKE'~
.
&GThe first player to attack a mob has the rights to the kill.  Others should
not get involved without being requested to do so.  Those receiving aid are 
under no obligation to reward their benefactors.  Monopolization of a mob and
its repops will not be tolerated.  This also includes monopolization of area
item repops.
 
Any disputes brought to the attention of an immortal for resolution will be
handled according to the immortal's discretion.  All such decisions are
final.
~

-1 'LAW STORES'~
.
&GShopkeepers inside Darkhaven are protected by the laws of the city's Lord,
Duke Luther.  As the gods have pledged their favor to Darkhaven, they have
imbued these shopkeepers with the powers necessary to carry out retribution
against those who defy these laws.  In short, anyone who chooses to attack
a Darkhaven shopkeeper will die brutally.  In addition, they may find
themselves facing the direct wrath of the gods in hell...
 
Those caught stealing from these shopkeepers will be incarcerated by the
guards of the Duke until such time as their release is granted by the gods.
 
A Darkhaven shopkeeper is any mob inside Darkhaven at which you can type
'list'.  If you are given a list of items for sale, or are told to try
back later, it is a shopkeeper.  This also applies to guild shopkeepers
and the blacksmith.

54 LAYERS~
.
&gLayers are currently available on the following wear locations:
 
&GAbout, Arms, Body, Feet, Hands, Legs, Waist.
 
&gLayers are set with a numeric value, or combination of values. The lower the
value, the lower the layer, or thinner the item of clothing/armor is. Valid
numeric values are:
 
&G0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128.
 
&gOr any combination of the above. A value of zero means no other items came
be layered with this item. Items of clothing can be layered over one another
as long as their layer values do not overlap. ie, if leather armor were set
to a value of 56 (8, 16, and 32), it could not layer with, say, a set of
heavy chain that is set to a value of 96 (32 and 64), as they overlap on the
layer value of 32.
 
It is suggested that only those items that will occupy the highest value 
slots, or a slot of 0, have any special affects added to them. Underclothing
should only have a.c. settings.

1 LCK LUCK~
Luck (LCK in your 'score') represents the tendency of a character to succeed
or prosper through chance or good fortune.  As in life, the exact extent of
this factor remains and will always remain shrouded in uncertainty...
 
Also as in life, however, it can be said with surety that its influence on a
character is pervasive.  Though it affects some aspects of life here in a
very direct manner, it can affect nearly every aspect to at least a degree.
 
~

2 LEADERSHIP~
A mortal cannot hold leadership positions in more than one
organization at the same time.  This applies to all organizations
regardless of whether they are peaceful or deadly.
~

1 LEAP~
Syntax:  leap
 
Leap is a skill that allows the player to 'leap' into the air to deliver
a kick or punch to the opponents head or upper chest area, depending on
the size of the player. If successfully landed, the opponent will take
damage. NOTE: This skill may be used to start fights so should not be
used on your fellow players unless under pkill conditions.

1 LETHARGY~
Syntax:  c lethargy <victim>
 
Lethargy reduces the victim's dexterity by two.
~

54 'LEVER FLAGS 2'~
Currently you can only set one flag at a time.  If you think you've got the
wrong flags on an item, "oset <item> v0 0" will reset the item to no flags.
Some of the flags operate on their own, others require other flags to be set
before they will work.
 
Flags affecting doors are :
unlock, lock, d_north, d_south, d_east, d_west, d_up,
d_down, door, open, close, passage
 
In order for any of these flags to work, a lever must have at least "door" set.
Once you've set the "door" flag, you will need to specify the direction you
want.  Currently, only the 6 main directions will work.
 
The "passage" flag will open a passage from the vnum specified in value1, to
the vnum specified in the lever's value2.
 
For instance:  A lever with the "door", "d_north", and "passage" flags set,
with a vnum of 10 in v1, and 11 in v2, when used, it will create a passage (one
way) from 10 to 11 to the north.
 
The other door affecting flags are pretty obvious.  A lever with the flags
"door", "d_north", and "unlock" set, with a vnum in v1 of 21000 would unlock
the north door at 21000 when used.  Levers with more than one flag will all
occur.  Doors can be "unlocked, opened, closed, locked" all in one lever use.
 
Flags affecting teleport are :
teleport, teleportall, teleportplus, showroomdesc
 
In order for any of the teleport flags to work, the item must have the
"teleport" flag set.  "Teleportall" teleports all players/mobs in the room to
the vnum specified in v1 of the object.  "Teleportplus" teleports all
mobs/players/objects in the room to the vnum specified in v1. The standard is
to teleport the player, but not show the room description to them.  If you set
the flag "showroomdesc" it will automatically show the room description to all
players that were teleported.
 
Other flags that currently work are:
rand4, rand6, autoreturn
 
Rand4 randomizes doors 0-3 in the specified room vnum in v1.
Rand6 randomizes doors 0-5 in the specified room vnum in v1.
Autoreturn keeps a lever in one position after it has been push/pulled.
   Setting this option will make a lever "pull" only, or "push" only.
 
All other lever flags do not currently work.

-1 LIZARDMAN LIZARDMEN LIZARD-MAN LIZARD-MEN 'LIZARD MAN' 'LIZARD MEN'~
&wLizardmen are semi-aquatic, breathing air but often dwelling totally
underwater.  They are often noted to use underwater caves as their
lair, and are typically found in swamps, marshes, and similar places.

Members of this race band together in rough tribal form; they are
omnivores, and are likely to prefer human flesh to other foods.
Due to this taste for humans, they suffer if their alignment strays
too much towards the honorable side of the spectrum.

The race, of course, has the &Ginnate ability to breathe under water&w
and is additionally &Gresistant to slashing attacks&w.

Lizard men gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 0.91.  The
lizard man nation currently lies in one of the marsh regions, but
the race is slowly dying.  Some say there is a new darkness in the
marsh lands, other say inbreeding is the cause, but the race is no
longer able to create progeny.
~

58 LOADUP~
Syntax:  loadup <player>
 
LOADUP allows one to load up a player's character (playing or not), to do
whatever needs be done to the character.  (Modifying a flag, changing a
password... etc).  Use FORCE to make the character do your bidding.
 
If we make any changes to the char, we comment the char and place a note in
their inventory explaining who loaded them up and what changes were made.
The character is transed to room 99 and forced to quit there (unless they
are going to be left in hell).  If we don't make any changes to the char, we
trans them back from where they came and force quit them there.  Loadup is
used primarily when a player quits to avoid dealing with immortals or if
they quit before you finish writing a comment.  But it is also used to
investigate chars for duping and other allegations made against them.
 
So... there is actually a wide range of reasons to use loadup and you are
encouraged to use your discretion in this area.
 
If you load up a character to slay or purge them, you must post in 1205.
 
See FORCE
~

0 LOCATE~
Syntax: cast 'locate object' <name>
 
A spell which helps reveal the location or bearer of objects

items, and recovery may take some time.  Also note that not all
objects may be revealed.
 
~

0 'LOCATE OBJECT'~

~

55 LOG SNOOP~
Syntax: log   <character>
Syntax: log   all
Syntax: snoop <character>

LOG <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into
the server's log file.  Like FREEZE, it is a permanent character toggle.

Certain commands (PASSWORD) are protected against LOG.  Conversely, certain
commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.

LOG ALL logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not
persist across reboots.

SNOOP shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.
The character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one
character at a time.
The input from the player will be displayed with a header of the players 
name and a percentage sign (i.e. Mudder%)
SNOOP yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.
-- Do not snoop people being intimate. <i.e. Mudsex, voyeurism, etc...>
-- Do not repeat information learned in snoop casually, especially to mortals
-- Only snoop a person talking to a higher level Immortal with the higher
   Immortals "Express Permission".
-- If a higher level Immortal begins communication with someone you are
     snooping, inform that higher Immortal immediately of the snoop.
-- Any incidental references learned in snoop should be disregarded
    ** For example, you hear someone is having a mud affair, it is not
    ** important to the reason you are snooping.  Do not judge or pass
    ** on information learned in this manner.
-- "Spot check" snooping of lower level Immortals is part of being a higher
   level immortal.  All Immortals may be snooped at any time, for any reason.
-- Do not snoop for the purpose of gaining information for personal reasons.
-- Being an Immortal is a privilege and a job.  Snoop is a tool to assist
   you do your job properly.  Snoop is neither a toy nor a right.

1 LOMAR 'KEEP OF LOMAR' HUMANTOWN~
During the dark time of the human race, the bands of humans feared daily
the raids from the surrounding orc tribes. It was a time of chaos and dread,
when no man could step foot outside at night without risking a blade in his 
back, or an arrow through his heart. 
 
The human leaders came together and decided that in order to protect their
people, they had to unite and build a place to defend themselves properly. 
A secret location was chosen, and a sturdy keep was built along the Westwick 
River. The remnants of all the human clans retreated to the keep and managed
to elude many of the orc tribes. The ones that discovered the keep were in
for a hard battle. 
 
Eventually, peace came, and the humans scattered away from the confinement
of the keep. They went on to build great cities, some as nearby as Ofcol. 
Soon, only a handful of families were left in the keep. Most of its wartime 
armaments were dismantled and it settled back into a small, tight knit 
community. 
 
It remains there today, forgotten in the memories of many, but still a 
stronghold for humanity should the need rise again.

0 MAGICUSER MAGE MAGES~
The mage is ultimately a being of pure magic, boasting by far the
sharpest minds retaining knowledge of some of the Realms' most
powerful spells.

The novice mage begins with a weak body, but as they grow in knowledge,
experience and power they become a powerful fighting force armed with
an arsenal of spells.  Their vast repertoire makes them a sought after
commodity in the Realms, for their spells can mean victory or defeat
for others.

Mages are not adept at physical combat, and prefer to use small weapons
such as daggers or small swords.
 
The following races are acceptable to the ways of the Mage:
Human Elf Pixie Half-Elf Gith Drow Sea-Elf Gnome
~

1 MAGIC_MISSILE~
Syntax: Cast Magic <mob>
 
Magic Missile  enables the caster to hit a victim with a blast of magic from a
distance. In order to work, the conditions must be right and the victim must be
visible to the caster. Attempting to hit a player with a missile will cause
the caster to be branded an Attacker. 
Ex: If an orc were one room to the west, you could hit the orc by typing
cast magic 'w orc'. (Note the single quotes needed)
~

1 'MAGNETIC THRUST'~
Syntax: c 'magnetic thrust' (target)

'Magnetic Thrust,' much like 'Sonic Resonance,' allows the casting
Mage to control the nature of space and time in the immediate locale
of his victim.  In this sorcery, the Mage forms a wedge of magnetic
energy within the body of the victim.  As the spell progresses, the
victims organs are violently rent and internal tissues are torn.  The
resulting pain and damage are formidable, indeed.

1 MAHN-TOR  KEEP 'THE KEEP OF MAHN-TOR'~
Recommended level range: 5 - 35
 
The city of minotaurs, Mahn-Tor, lies on the continent of Antarctica, across
the lapping red waves of the Blood Sea. Most adventurers reach this land
through the ancient Blood Sea Portal. Named after its ruler, Mahn-Tor was
founded long ago after a dark, unknown sect created the minotaur race by
joining the features of bulls with unwilling humans. This savage race
eventually rebelled and won its freedom. In recent years, the minotaur race
has become much more civilized and though tempted to joing the forces of
Light, they remain in neutral in the war between Good and Evil.

MaidenStone considers itself not so much as a group of individuals with
like-minded interests and varying backgrounds of race and class, but a
sisterhood and a family.  It is said that once you become a MaidenStone,
you will never feel lonely, afraid or helpless.  For once you have become
enfolded within the Order, you are given the proper tools to survive by
your wits, yet always with the assurance that your sisters are there for
you at a moment's notice, should you require it.
 
To receive a Maidenstone handbook,  inquire about the Order, or request
to join MaidenStone, please speak to maidens with [QM] in their
titles (Quest Mistress).  You can also speak with any of the three leaders;
they can be found by typing ORDERS MS.
 
Please note that only female characters who are level 30 and above may
request to join the Order.

&wOut of the primeval, outdated notions of female roles and their place
&wwithin society, the goddess Circe sought to reconstruct the need for a
&wcollective group of women by breaking down the chains of male-produced
&wnotions of female behavior and their role within the community.  Out of
&wthese dark times rose an all-girl clan of righteous, post-apocalyptic
&wultra-deadly women.  When the blight across the land caused all clans
&wto fall and be destroyed, MaidenStone, like a dark phoenix rising from
&wthe ashes, rose again in a renewed incarnation.  Vowing to never raise
&wtheir weapons to another person again, they sought to uphold the ideals
&wof female solidarity, self-reliance, individuality, loyalty and strength.
&w 
&wMaidenStone has been a trendsetter amongst the Orders, setting the pace 
&wfor others to draw from, as can be seen in their strong doctrine, focus
&won role-playing, levels and titles, literature, and questing policy.

57 MAPOUT~
The following are a list of commands that _can_ be used with the
mapout function. Many will cause problems, so stick to these few:
 
= Sector: 0 (inside), name: tunnel
$ Sector: 0 (inside), name: well
% Sector: 1 (city), name: street
< Sector: 1 (city), name: sombody ignored this room
| Sector: 3 (forest), name: path
_ Sector: 3 (forest), name: a forest clearing
) Sector: 4 (hills), name: road
> Sector: 4 (hills), name: a natural bridge
& Sector: 5 (mountains), name: the canyon
+ Sector: 5 (mountain), name: snake pit
( Sector: 5 (mountains), name: mine
- Sector: 6 (swim), name: on a stream
^ Sector: 7 (noswim), name: on the river
* Sector: 10 (desert), name: beach
 
To build a map, start with 'map write'. Within that buffer, input the
number of symbols you would like across and down (columns and rows).
Use 'map show' to make sure you have input correctly, then 'map create'
to make your map a part of your area. The automapper will start with
the lowest available vnum, and connect where directed. For instance:
 
------
------
 
Will generate a mini-area which runs 6 east-west and 2 north-south.
Each section will be connected to whatever is close to it, but not to
other vnums in your area. All connections outside the mapper must be
made manually.
~

1 MATHLANN LAGOON~
Secreted beyond the intimidating black cliffs which border the
southern fringe of the Ocean Keep, lies a pool of deep, crystal clear
water known as Mathlann Lagoon.  This peaceful haven is home to
the Sea-Elf Nation.  The tranquil briny waters invite all Sea-Elves
to plunge into their depths.

~

54 MCREATE OCREATE~
Syntax: mcreate <vnum> <keywords>
Syntax: ocreate <vnum> <keywords>

Create and new mobile / object.
A prototype monster or object will be created with the selected vnum, and
set up with the plainest of default values.  A material image of the magical
prototype will appear before you, for you to futher modify with MSET or OSET.

See MSET or OSET.
~

58 MDELETE ODELETE RDELETE MDEL RDEL ODEL~
&YSyntax&W:  rdelete <roomvnum>
&YSyntax&W:  mdelete <mobilevnum>
&YSyntax&W:  odelete <objectvnum>
 
The r/m/o delete commands allow an immortal to delete any rooms,
objects, or mobiles within their assigned areas. This can be helpful
during building, when errors are made, or when several vnums need to be
set aside for a special, reserved purpose.

1 MEDITATE MEDITATION~
&YSyntax&W: meditate
 
Meditate places your character in a meditative state during which mana can
be rapidly regenerated.  Once you begin meditating you cannot engage in other
activities (or type other commands) or you will break the meditative state.

While meditating will see your mana regenerate every few seconds until you
are at your maximum.  Certain classes and races will see differing amounts of
mana based on what "sector" you are in.  For instance, Druids must be in a 
natural type sector to gain any mana during their meditation.

Meditation regenerates mana less rapidly than trancing.

-1 MENTALSTATE MENTALSTATES 'MENTAL STATE' 'MENTAL STATES'~
.
&gYour mental state is your current frame of mind, and how clearly and
realistically you view your surroundings.  Mental states can be affected
by prolonged combat, hunger, thirst, or poison.  If you are affected by
one of the above for a period of time, your mental state will begin to
deteriorate, and you will not view your surroundings as they truly are.
You may begin to hallucinate, or become too lethargic to function, and
your general abilities will be affected.  In extreme cases you may
collapse from exhaustion or enter a delirious coma.
 
To restore your mental state, you may need to rest (resting and sleeping
will speed your recovery), eat, cure whatever poison afflicts you, etc.
Note that if you are malnourished your state will &wnot&g improve, even with
sleep, until you have fed and/or quenched your thirst.
 
Your mental state is by the text line in 'score' which describes your state
of mind (You feel great, etc.)  The 'group' display contains a less accurate
reading of your and your group-mates' mentalstates as well.
 
Note:  Changing your deity now affects your mental state.

53 MENU~
When in one of the menu systems (RMENU, OMENU, MMENU), to switch from one
page to another, type '- <letter>'.  (For example, '- a' will bring you to
the first page in the current menu system).

'- h' will bring up a help file in any menu system.

'+ <name>' in OMENU or MMENU will change the object or mobile being edited
if it exists in your inventory/room respectively.

The old man leaned back in his rocking chair and took another puff from his 
pipe.
 
"Yarr, thar's a word I haven't heard in a while.  What brought the Merida to 
yer attention?"
 
The tone of the old captain's response brings a slight shiver to your spine as
you try to stammer out a response.
 
Don't ye go messin' with the Merida.  Ye'll find yerself swimmin with Davy
Jones, says I.  They're the scurviest bunch of Sea-Dogs ye can find about these
nay... ANY parts of the world.  They'll just as soon slit yer throat and take
yer women as they would do anything else."
 
After trying to explain that you're interested in JOINING the Merida, the old
man lets out a loud, bellowing laugh.
 
"Har, ye look a little on the scrawny side, but perhaps they can find some use
for ye.  I suggest ya start swimmin, you'll find 'em eventually!"

51 MICRO_GM~
.Subject:  GM vs Microsoft
     
     At a recent computer expo (COMDEX), Bill Gates reportedly compared the 
     computer industry with the auto industry and stated, "If G.M. had kept
     up with technology like the computer industry has, we would all be 
     driving twenty-five dollar cars that got one-thousand miles to the 
     gallon." In response to Bill's comments, General Motors issued a press 
     release stating, "If G.M. had developed technology like Microsoft, we 
     would all be >driving cars with the following characteristics:
     
     1. For no reason whatsoever, your car would crash twice a day. 
     2. Every time they repainted the lines on the road you would have to 
     buy a new car.
     
      3. Occasionally, your car would die on the freeway for no reason, and 
     you would just accept this, restart, and drive on.
     
     4. Occasionally, executing a manner such as a left turn, would cause 
     your car to shut down and refuse to restart, in which case you would 
     have >to reinstall the engine.
     
     5. Only one person at a time could use the car, unless you bought 
     "Car95" or "CarNT." But then you would have to buy more seats.
     
     6. Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, reliable,
     five times as fast, and twice as easy to drive, but would only run on 
     five percent of the roads.
     
     7. The oil, water temperature, and alternator warning lights would be 
     replaced by a single "general car default" warning light.

     8. New seats would force everyone to have the same size butt. 
     9.The airbag system would say "Are you sure?" before going off.
     10. Occasionally for no reason whatsoever, your car would lock you out 
     and refuse to let you in until you simultaneously lifted the door 
     handle, turned the key, and grabbed hold of the radio antenna.
     
   
 11. G.M. would require all car buyers to also purchase a deluxe set of 
     Rand McNally road maps (now a G.M. subsidiary), even though they 
     neither need them nor want them. Attempting to delete this option 
     would immediately cause the car's performance to diminish by fifty 
     percent or more. Moreover, G.M. would become a target for 
     investigation by the Justice Department.
     
     12. Every time G.M. introduced a new model, car buyers would have to 
     learn how to drive all over again because none of the controls would 
     operate in the same manner as the old car.
     
     13. You'd press the "start" button to shut off the engine.

1 'MIDAS TOUCH' 'MIDAS'~
Syntax:  cast 'midas touch' <name of object in inventory>
Syntax:  c 'midas touch' <name of object in inventory>
 
A spell in keeping with its namesake from lore, this spell can be
used to convert an item into gold coins.  The currency returned
from an item is usually only a fraction of its monetary cost/value/
worth, but the wiser and more intelligent spellcasters may on
occasion succeed in converting the item itself into pure gold.
~

1 MIDEN'NIR~
Recommended level range: 5 - 15

The Miden'nir is a dark, stunted forest populated by a tribe of goblins.
The goblins have been steadily suffering losses to Darkhaven's
adventurers and now roam the forest more rarely (to the relief of many
peasants). In the western part of the forest is an inn where a bard plays
regularly to the amusement of the inn's patrons. Some trails near the inn
have recently become dangerous due to a group of marauders who call
themselves the Black Riders.
~

1 MIDWAY 'MIDWAY OF DESPAIR'~
The Midway comes to town only a few times a year, bringing with it
mirth and excitement!  Travelling merchants and faire workers converge
in a secret location (only accessible by means of a magical rope) and
assemble their colorful tents.  Adventurers flock to the Midway to
enjoy rare food and drink, games of chance and ocassionally arena
fights.  Many vendors and craftspersons peddle the best of their wares
in the cobblestoned Marketplace.  Games of chance and skill offer gold
and sometimes items as prizes.
~

65 MIND~
~

1 'MIND FORTRESS'~
Syntax: Cast mind
 
This spell works well for a group who can merge their minds to create
a fortress against magic.
It affects intelligence and save vs. spell.
~

1 'MINIMUM POSITION' 'MINIMUM' 'POSITIONS'~
At current time, there are 14 "positions" in the game. Positions
are in a special order.  If position b is below position a on the
list, that indicates that while in position b, you have more 
physical or mental energy to spend on a task, be it a command,
a spell, or a skill.
 
For example, while standing, you have a greater ability to do things
than while sitting.  While fighting evasively, you have more options
than while fighting aggressively.
 
The ordered list is as follows, left to right, top to bottom:
Dead          Mortally Wounded        Incapacitated
Stunned       Sleeping                Fighting (Berserk)
Resting       Fighting (Aggressive)   Sitting
Fighting (Std)Fighting (Defensive)    Fighting (Evasive)
Standing      Mounted

1 'MINOR INVOCATION'~
Syntax:  cast 'minor invocation'
 
This spell improves the to-hit roll and saving throw versus spell of all

~

1 MINPOS~
Minimum Positions affect both spells and skills. For example, if the minimum
position for a spell was 8, it would work while sitting, fighting or any
position higher than that. The same spell would not work in the resting
position as it's ranked at 6.
0 POS_DEAD

~

1 MISSILE~
Missile weapons have the unique ability to fire at one's opponent
from a distance.  In order to be successful, the attacker must have a 
weapon missile wielded (Only certain weapons are able to be missile wielded)
and must have an appropriate ammunition in inventory.

Example: To use a bow and arrow, one must have a bow missile wielded and
have an arrow in inventory.
 
See help &Wfire and help &Wfletch
~

54 MISSILES~
Creating a projectile is basically the same as making any other
weapon. The exception to this are its Values (see ITEMVALUES)
and the need to have missiles which match missileweapons.
 
&GFollow this basic proceedure to make a set of projectiles&W:
  1) Create a firing mechanism, for instance, a long bow.
  2) Set the itemtype to 'missileweapon'.
  3) Set the wearflags to 'take missile'
  4) Set the projectile values from the HELP ITEMVALUES table.
  5) Set the Value3 (V3) from the table in HELP WEAPONTYPES.
 
&G Now the wielded weapon is done, but you need something to fire...&W
  1) Create a shootable object, for instance, an arrow.
  2) Set the itemtype to 'projectile'
  3) Set the wearflags to 'take'.
  4) Set the projectile values from the HELP ITEMVALUES table.
  5) Set the V3 to match the V3 on the firing mechanism you created.
 
Don't forget to finish the items with weight, cost, long, short etc.
You now have two objects in inventory which are ready to fire.
Lastly, you may create a quiver for certain objects. To do this,
set the itemtype to 'quiver', and use v0 to set its capacity.
Be sure not to set the capacity too high, as quivers should be small.

The vampire may become a fine mist, capable of traveling with great speed
and precision through the smallest of cracks and crevices to reach its
intended victim.
 
Due to the nature of this skill, it only works in darkest night (between
the hours of 9 o'clock in the night and 5 o'clock in the morning).
 
~

1 'MITHRIL HALL'~
Recommended level range: 35 - 50


Mithril Hall's creation is, like many other Realms of Despair, rooted
to Vl'Arescht's whim. Long ago, the Lord of Darkness created a shadow
dragon, which he named Shimmergloom, unleashing havoc upon the races
of Light. The fearsome beast, aided by might shadow hounds and dread
clerics, brought about thirty years of pain and sorrow. It was then
that the legendary Daskyn arose. This heroic man, whose name will be
forever remembered in song, drove back the dragon, tracking it back
to its lair in Garum's Gorge. There, the hero magically sealed
Shimmergloom in it's lair, unable to kill it as Vl'Arescht had blessed it
with eternal life. The dragon's rage was unending however, and it
summoned forth a torrent of servants, sending them to destroy the
peaceful settlements nearby. Our good King Welmar dispatched a legion
of dwarven berserkers to end this shadowy obstacle. With the aid of
the human Cattie-Brie, the dark elf Drizzt Do'Urden, the barbarian
Wulfgar and many others, the keep of Mithril Hall was founded, resting
near the steep cliff face of Garum's Gorge. The battleragers of the keep
maintain a vigilant guard, ensuring that the followers of Shimmergloom
shall never arise from the canyon.
~

54 MLIST~
Syntax: mlist
      :	mlist <first mob>
      :	mlist <first mob> <last mob>

is entitled to do combat with the mobile as it was originally designed.
 
You may_not_cast any helpful or shielding spells on mobiles, whether
they are currently engaged in battle with other players or will engage
in combat with other  players at some time in the future.
 
In addition, mobiles with specific functions, like Hometown guards, are
equipped to do their job, without the assistance of players, and should
not be assisted by way of helpful or shielding spells.

&Rherein are based on the distribution SMAUG 1.4a. Any changes made since that
&Rpoint will not be reflected in any way.
&G
I am going to attempt to unfold the mystery that surrounds the topic of mob
creation that is called "experience."  You may want to have a calculator handy.
This is no topic for the novice builder, but it is one that must be learned in
the long run in order to create and publish professional and usable worlds in
the SMAUG code base.
 
&WRule #1 &G- Building an area is not a recreational sport. If you have never
been a dungeon master in a table top role play game, consider this: most DM's
take MANY, many hours contemplating one evening of role play. How every crea-
ture they've created, every house, building, tower and animal is going to react
to the players sitting around the table. When you create an area for an online
game, your biggest chore will be putting YOU inside the mobs/rooms/objects
FOREVER.  YOU have to be able to run the area every time a new player goes
through it.  YOU have to design for every mentality, and every possible combin-
ation of ideas that a player on the other side of a fiber optic line will come
up with. The worst part, is you can't be there the first time a player goes
through. If you are building a "fluff" area that won't have a major theme, then
you can skip some steps. However, EXPERIENCE and MOB CREATION are not steps you
can skip without warping the leveling system.
 
&WRule #2&G - Leveling was NOT meant to be easy. Like it or not, regardless of
what MUD you come from, the code appears to be designed around the same con-
cepts of the old days of role play, where only a FEW make it to the top. Any
alteration to this ideal will lead to challenging problems in the areas of
leveling and building.

&WRule #3&G - All of the stats a mob is allowed to be given, are supposed to be
used.  While some stats will be defaulted by the code, most will be considered
as ZERO's when that mob is put to use. Those that are defaulted by the code are
generally better just counted as zeros anyway, because that's what they'll do
for your experience situations, ZERO.

&GOk then.  Ready for the magic number?? Ready for the big kahuna?!
 
&Y(level*level*level*5) + maxhitpoints -((ac-50)*2)+(((damnum*damsize)+damroll)
&Y*50) + (Hitroll*level*10)
&G
What does this all mean? You really don't wanna know. Besides, given a calcu-
lator and some time, anyone can do the math. What's important is this: out of
that formula, what parts of your mob most affect a mobs experience worth.
&G
Before any of this matters, you need to know what your maximum and minimum
amounts of experience allowable are, as coded in your mud. Distribution SMAUG
1.4a was a minimum of 20, and maximum of 500k. So lets break down the exper-
ience formula a bit.
&G
Let us look at an example mobs stats that pertain to the above:
&R
Level: 25            Maxhitpoints : 2000          Armorclass: -190
Damdie: 4d4+30       Damroll: 30                  Hitroll: 9
&G
The formula adds up like so :
&C
           Level*Level*Level*5 =     78125
                 +Maxhitpoints =    + 2000
                 - ((ac-50)*2) =    - -480 (or +480)
+((damnum*damsize+damroll)*50) =    + 2300
           +(Hitroll*level*10) =    + 2250
           -------------------      ------
                BASE EXP WORTH       85155
&G
What does this number mean? Nothing, on its own. WHAT?! All that math for a
meaningless number? Well, yes. And no.  This number is going to get changed
A LOT from here to the end of the math. So follow me slowly.
&G
Next, we need to check if the mob is affected by sanctuary, shockshield or
fireshield.  Why these three?  Because it's coded that way. A mob that is
affected by sanctuary has its total exp worth increased by 1.5 times. A mob
that is affected by shockshield or fireshield has it increased by 1.2 times.
&W
SEE NEXT: MOBCREATE3
~

53 MOBCREATE3~
&GSo we add this to the formula. For our example, the mob will have all three
affect types on.
&C
               BASE EXP WORTH        85155
               AFF SANCTUARY       +127732
               ---------------------------
               SUBTOTAL             212887
               AFF FIRESHIELD      +255464
               ---------------------------
               SUBTOTAL             468352
               AFF SHOCKSHIELD     +562022
               ---------------------------
               TOTAL EXP WORTH     1030374
&G
But as we stated above, the total experience a mob can be worth is limited by
a hard code to 500k xp. So we will use 500000 as our magic number from here on
out. We'll place an example or two for lower levels along the way. (Notice also
that the mob used in this example is Level 25, yet still more than maxes out
the experience system of a distribution SMAUG mud.)
&G
From here, we have to move into combat and find out just how it is that a PC
will reap the benefits of our beautifully created mobile.
 
        &WEXAMPLE:&R Using the above mob we add -
        &RLevel 22 Warrior with an alignment of 1000
        &RThe mobile has an alignment of -1000
        &RThe warrior does 100 hitpoints of damage in ONE ROUND.
&G
For even just as simple a thing as a single hit, the code tosses some more
calculations and formulas into the mix.
&G
First the mud considers the level difference between PC and mobile. To a
certain extent, the number of levels a PC is lower than a mobile, the mud
increases the &CTOTAL EXP WORTH&G of the mob.
&G
Next, we consider alignments. If a PC is 1000+ points differnt than the mob in
alignment, the &CTOTAL EXP WORTH&G is multiplied times 1.25. However, if a GOOD
aligned PC attacks a GOOD aligned mobile, the &CTOTAL EXP WORTH&G is multiplied
by 0.75.
&G
Next we randomize life, as it should be and spit out a value from 3/4 times the
TOTAL EXP WORTH to 1 1/4 times the TOTAL EXP WORTH for the USABLE EXP.
 
&WSEE NEXT: MOBCREATE4
~

53 MOBCREATE4~
&G
Back to our example, our mob had 2000 max hp.  200 damage done is 5%. The mud
now spits back out 5% of USABLE EXP and multiplies it times 0.85.  This is the
amount of experience a character receives when he hits our mob for 200 hitpoint
damage.
&G
The math explained :
&C
      Level Difference (3)        =   650000 (TOTAL EXP WORTH * 1.3)
     *Alignment Difference (2000) =   * 1.25
      ---------------------------     ------
      SUBTOTAL                    =   812500
      USABLE EXP                  =   Between 609375 and 1015625
  (No modifier for good attacking
   good gets used in this example)
      Damage to Mob (5%)*.85      =   Between 25898 and 43163
                                           THIS IS _ONE_ ROUND!
&G
What things can you do to decrease this value? The easiest, quickest, simplest
ways to defeat this problem are.....
&W       A. Increase Max Hitpoints (decrease percentage from damage)
&W       B. Decrease Level (Quickest way to reduce the TOTAL EXP WORTH)
&G
The above formulas are applied to EVERY type of damage, except for CIRCLE and
BACKSTAB, which yield NO Experience. This was done so that the experience
system and damage systems could be left relatively safe, while still keeping
the powerful skills in place.
&W
IN CONCLUSION.. &GWhat are the things you are considering when you build a mob?
First, only make the mob as high a level as its hit points and damage returned
rate. My general rule of thumb starts with NO LESS than 100 hitpoints PER
LEVEL of mob. A 100 hitpoints/level mob is a decent leveling mob in most in-
stances. Any less than this, you have a powerleveling mob. Think about the
level of characters intended to be in your area attacking your mobiles. Then go
find out what their average stats are. Pay particular attention to Hitroll,
Average damage (which means damroll as well as average weapon damage), armor
class, alignment and avg max hitpoints.

1 'MORGUL VALE'~
Recommended level range: 35 - 50

No race has plagued the battle for Light more than the orcs of Morgul
Vale. The orcish population ever-swelling, their incredible numbers
made it impossible to banish them all to their land, as was done with
many other singular beings of Darkness. After a dozen years of war, it
was discovered that an entity of pure darkness named Sauron led the
orcs with the aid of nine minions known as Nazguls. Further research
proved that this entity was very chaotic. A plan was made and executed,
where a party of orcs was led into some clerics of the Dread Lord Seth.
Without hesitation, the orcs slaughtered the dark priests. Lord Seth
took this as a personal offence. His fury was brief but deadly as fire
rained from the sky and Sauron was imprisoned in a strange, tangible
darkness. The orcish population was utterly devastated and the race
no longer has the numbers to wage war. The majority of orcs have
sought refuge in Morgul Vale, and the races of Light have grudgingly
given them ownership of this realm. Many adventurers go hunting there
for sport, yet very few who enter the Vale leave with their body, or
soul, intact.
~

1 MORIA~
Recommended level range: 5 - 15

The vast mountain range of Moria lies to the northeast of Darkhaven,
spanning much of the northern landscape of Despair. Its twisting tunnels
and caverns house dozens of vile races who seem engaged in a perpetual
war to conquer this dark realm. These dread mountains also surround the
hated Morgul Vale, providing an excellent defence for what remains of the
orcish race.

0 MOUNT DISMOUNT~
Syntax: mount <mob>
Syntax: dismount

Mount is a skill, which allows you to mount certain mobs.  Being mounted 
on a mob cuts down on movement points that are used whenever you move.
 
New water sectors allow a person mounted to traverse them without damage
from drowning.  If you are in an area where your movement points begin
to drop suddenly and/or you begin to lose hps <hitpoints> quickly, you
should try to mount immediately.
~

1 'MOUNT KROZLOY'~
To the far west and north of Darkhaven, past the Hills of Moria,
in the Kingdom of Juargan, lies the home of the Half-Orc Nation.
Mount Krozloy is a heavily fortified, and easily guarded natural
stronghold, where the Half-Orcs gather to plan for battle and
conquest.

1 'MOUNTAINS OF DESOLATION' MOUNTAINS DESOLATION'~
Once home to a thriving Dwarven city, the area now known as the Mountains
of Desolation has become a land for the dead and appears to hold little to
entice the living. The mountains tower high above any of the neighbouring
cities and cast a lasting shadow on nearby inhabitants. Bards tell the 
tales of adventurers who have never returned and of seeing creatures that
are certainly not in the realm of the living. The dwarves that once lived
in those mountains are now long gone, replaced by rumours of hidden treasure,
living legacies, and perhaps even the wandering dead.
~

1 MOVE MOVEMENT~
This discusses the process of moving your character from one place in the
Realms to another.  The common movements are north, east, south, west, up
down, northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest.  You may also move
in these directions by the use of n, e, s, w, u, d, ne, se, sw, and nw.
If you need to pass through a door, at times they require being unlocked
and opened. To unlock a door, you type UNLOCK <direction or door name>.
To open a door, you type OPEN <direction or door name>.
 
At times, you may run out of movement points or require healing.  To allow
for faster recovery, you may SIT, REST, or SLEEP. When you are finished
with your recovery, and wish to continue adventuring, type WAKE or STAND.
 
For more detailed information on movement and doors, read sections 7 and
8 of your Adventurer's Guide book.

be targeted by an 'mpapply <victim>' which will inform the immortals that
the character is waiting for authorization.  Once the character is
authorized, a mob will attempt to 'mapplyb <victim>' the character, and
the character will be sent into the actual game.

of gold coins from an area.  These can be used in conjunction with mpat
to tell the mob which area to withdraw/deposit money in.
 
Example:  mpat 21000 mpwithdraw 5000000
 
This would cause the mob to withdraw 5 million coins from the new Darkhaven
area, as that is the area vnum 21000 is in.
 
If no mpat is used, the mob will withdraw or deposit the gold from the
area in which it is located at the time.

~

54 MPFLAG MPRMFLAG~
Syntax:  mpflag      <victim> <flag> <value>
         mprmflag    <victim> <flag> <value>
 
Using these commands you can assign variables based on 128 "bits". These bits
work like "On/Off" switches and may be assigned by any mob.  A typical mpflag
will look like :
 
                      testing:3=[1]
 
"testing" is the name of the flag, "3" is the vnum of the mob that assigned the
flag, and the "[1]" is the bit that is enabled. When more than one bit is
enabled, it will look more like:
 
                testing:3=[1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1]
 
In this case, bits 1 and 11 are enabled, 2-10 are disabled. To make use of
these flags, use the "isflagged" ifchecks. Mpflags will be assigned to a player
for a mobs "level X intelligence". The flag will save when the character saves
and will continue to exist for this amount of time "mudtime".  You can also
set the timer for a tag using the commands "noexpire" or "timer".
 
Eg.    mpflag noexpire $n <flag> [value]
       mpflag timer <#> $n <flag> [value]
 
If no timer is designated, the timer is set based on the mobs intelligence
multiplied by the mobs level.

Use 'mpinvis' alone to toggle the invisibility.
 
Use 'mpinvis <level>' to set the level at which the mob will be invis.
 
Mortals under the mobinvis level of the mob will be unable to see the mob
when it goes mobinvis; they cannot see it with any spell, it will be
completely invisible to them.
 
Be warned, however, that its programs will still function as normal, the
mortal will simply see a 'someone' if it performs an action or an echo
that they see, just as if a wizinvis immortal performed the action.
 
Also be warned that at the present time, area attacks _will_ hit a mobinvis
creature even if it is invisible.

~

54 MPTAG MPRMTAG~
Syntax:  mptag      <victim> <tag> [value]
         mprmtag    <victim> <tag>
 
Using these commands, you can assign a "tag", or "variable" to a character,
either just the tag, or the tag and a value associated with it.
 
The "tag" can be both a "string variable" (a group of characters, or words) or
an "integer" variable, a number. If using a number you can use the ifcheck
"istagged" to compare how big or little the number is using <>= operators.
 
The tag assigned to a character will last on the character based on the mob's
intelligence and level that assigned it. ( eg INT x LEVEL ) So a level 10 mob
with an intelligence of 13 will tag for a length of 130 ticks. These tags will
save to a characters pfile and will last over logging out and logging in.  You
can also set the timer for a tag using the commands "noexpire" or "timer".
 
Eg.    mptag noexpire $n <tag> [value]
       mptag timer <#> $n <tag> [value]
 
You can additionally specify a vnum to be associated with a particular tag.
Tagging a mob with the 0 vnum allows all mobs to see/modify that tag.

Eg.    mptag $n <tag>:<vnum> [value]
       mptag $n <tag>:0      [value]

Mprmtag can also be used to clear all bits of a particular mpflag. See "mpflag"
for more information.

54 MSET~
Syntax: mset <character> <field> <value>
        mset character on
 
MSET sets the properties of mobiles. If a mobile has the PROTOTYPE flag, 
modifying an instance of this mobile will also modify the index mobile, which 
all other instances of the mobile are based on.
 
MSET ON will lock you onto a particular mob/character. Once locked on, all
mset commands will imply 'mset <character>'. Hitting enter while in MSET ON
will give you an mstat of the mob/character you are working on. To get out
of MSET ON, simply type the word DONE. Example:
 
        mset gracca on
        long A large hulking figure stands here.
        sex 1
        done

0 MUDMAIL MAIL~
Syntax: mail list
Syntax: mail read    <number>
Syntax: mail read    all
Syntax: mail write
Syntax: mail subject <string>
Syntax: mail to      <to-list>
Syntax: mail take    <number>
Syntax: mail show
Syntax: mail post
Syntax: mail remove  <number>

The mail command is very similar to the note command.  To write mail, as 
in notes, you must have a blank note held in your hands, and a quill or 
pen in your inventory.  Mail can only be addressed to real players, or 
'all'.  There is a charge for reading and taking mail.

To post mail to more than one party, use 'note to <name> <name> <name>', etc.
Note that any of the named parties can remove the mail before the other
parties get a chance to read it.

See also 'HELP BOARDS', 'HELP NOTE'.

1 MUDSIGN~
Mudsigning a note places your name on the note. Once done, the note
cannot be altered or changed. To mudsign a note, first write your note
(see help NOTE, help NOTE2 and help EDITOR) and then go to any noteboard
and type note post. Scan over the notes by typing note list, find the
number of your note and type note take (#). (# being the number of your
note.) ie: note take 2.
 
This can also be done at any mailboard by typing mail post, mail list
and then mail take (#).

1 MULTIPLAY MULTIPLAYING~
Multi-playing up to 8 characters is permitted, with the following rules:
 
 - you may only have one character link-live if it is a deadly character
   (if it appears under the "who deadly" section of the who list).  You may
   have more than one character online as long as none of your characters
   are listed under the "who deadly" section of the who list.
 
 - using multiple characters to spam any player or channel via making all
   characters say/tell/chat/avtalk a same message or series of messages
   is highly frowned upon and may earn each character a silence.
 
NOTE:  Link-dead characters are not considered to be "online."

Suddenly out of nowhere, a hideous beast appears, bringing with it the
horrible smell of brimstone, death and decay!

The demon gives you the most evil and spine tingling sneer that makes you
fall to your knees, and release your bladder... 

The next second, the immense mass of slimey muscle and claws is all over you
...shredding you to a bloody mess!

Mercifully, everything goes black as it moves its widening maw towards your
head...

...Everything begins to fade to black.

You feel yourself leaving your body... rising up into the air, you feel
indeed much more free than you have ever felt before...

You float high into the heavens... a vortex of ever-changing curved beams
of colored light swirling around you faster and faster...

Your soul is bursting with emotions you can barely conceive...
You feel a burning inside... both cold and hot... a tingle of electricity
grows into a powerful buzzing surge jolting through every inch of your body.

A strange chorus of voices begins to sing indecipherable and long forgotten
words... the singing grows louder and louder... a million voices as one.

You feel yourself losing touch with reality... and all goes quiet.

...You begin to feel light-headed.

Your hands begin to tingle softly...
The feeling quickly grows into a strange radiating pulse of energy! 

The tingle rises up your arms and into your head, filing your mind with
visions of worlds of wonder, far off places, great towers, vast mountains,
oceans, seas, lush valleys, dark caverns and twisted passages...
 
You sense a feeling of wonderous potential and power in your hands...
Enough power to build and create these visions for yourself!

You feel much more powerful, eager and inspired!
~

-1 M_GODLVL4_~
...You feel slightly faint as your head begins to spin.

Your hands begin to tingle once more...
A vortex of energy starts to swirl throughout your hands, going faster
and faster... becoming almost painful! 

Beams of light break through your skin, one at a time, then more and
more until the light is almost to bright to bear...

As your squint your eyes, you perceive a vision of great beasts of wonder,
dangerous and unnatural fiends, pixies, faeries, tribes and clans, peoples
of all kinds, ancient forgotten artifacts, weapons of vast untapped powers,
crystal balls, magick rings, staves, wands, rods, arcane tomes of untold
secrets... your mind is bursting with inspiration...
 
You sense a new, reborn feeling of unlimited potential and power...
In your hands the power to build and create these visions for yourself!

The bright light from your hands fades away... but strange faint glow
remains always.

You are suddenly filled with a strange calmness and inner peace that you have
not experienced before.
 
As you try to snap out of it, you hear some soft, wonderously enchanting music
and a beautiful little faerie flies around from behind you, singing in the
most lovely voice you've ever heard.
 
Her words are hard for you to understand as they are in an ancient tongue,
but you get the idea she is singing about the coming of an extremely joyous
and important event!
 
She reaches into a small pouch, and retrieves a shimmering scroll...

-1 NANNY_AUGURER~
The Augurer is very strong-minded in its nature, both physically and
magically. It is very confident of its actions in combat, and this
confidence shows in its physical appearance.  The Augurer is of a
medium height, with a defined bone structure which shows both
intelligence and assurance.  Its appearance is wizened, but at times
the Augurer may look frail due to exhaustion.  Though it is of a
medium size, its physical strength is not.  The Augurer relies on
both brain and brawn to overcome its challengers.  When it is
confronted, its wisdom decides what course of action it should take,
and wisdom is its prime stat.
 
While in combat, the Augurer is capable of utilizing both spells and
skills to their greatest potential.  However, because of the Augurer's
size, it tires of magic easily.  To overcome this mental exhaustion,
the Augurer is a strong believer in the use of mana for rejuvination
of its magical powers, and uses a lot of it.  In its spare time, the
Augurer enjoys the local lore, both the teaching and learning of it,
as well as musical and theatrical pursuits.  The Augurer is a very
independent person, and spends much of its spare time in meditation,
reflecting upon the day's activities.
~

-1 NANNY_CLERIC~
A cleric is a mighty healer and protector of the weak.  Led with a mission
to heal and teach, Clerics have many  varied and sundry healing spells at
their command.

While clerics possess some combat spells and magic to affect one's chances
in battle, their main goal is self preservation.  They accelerate in wisdom
and knowledge as they gain in level and experience.

The wisdom of the cleric in the ways of magic and the art of healing, make
them an extremely desirable asset for any group.
~

-1 NANNY_DROW~
&wDrow are the darker, more evil cousins of Elves.  They were once part of
the happier community of Elves which roam the forests today, but have
long since moved under the ground, building vast subterranean cities and
complex networks of caves.

Drow have dark skin and light hair, and are moderately weaker and have
a more slight constitution than average humans.  Still, like all Elves,
they have a slightly higher dexterity than men.

Members of this race specialize in spell casting, and have thus developed
a very high intelligence.  Being creatures of darkness the Drow tend to
fight more proficiently in the darkness, and have &Ginnate infravision&w
with which to discern objects and living things in the absence of light.
They also possess inherent &Gscry&w, and are &Gresistant to poison.&w
 
Drow gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 1.08.  The subterranean
drow city lies somewhere beyond the northern plains.
~

-1 NANNY_DRUID~
The druid is a lover and protector of the natural land.  Be it the forests
full of centaurs and deer, the streams full of fish, or the bug-infested
swamps, a druid always seeks to protect and preserve nature.  Wielding
mighty spells from the gods themselves, druids strive hard at their work.
 
Strong in wisdom, with a body trained to near perfection by their rugged
lifestyle, a druid has many disciplines upon which to draw.  From powerful
spells of healing which can bring the near dead back to full vigor, to the
ability to mystically create water and food, to the awesome power of nature
which they command in battle via spells able to quake the land and split
the sky, druids demonstrate that mastery of magic is not just a hobby, but
a way of life for them.  Able to face many warriors on almost even footing,
and able to shield themselves nearly as well as some mages, druids are
truly a gifted class.
~

-1 NANNY_DWARF~
&wThe Dwarven race was the fourth of the Realms, fashioned from earth and
stone by the gods and melded by fire.  They are long-lived, fiercely
loyal, and are known equally for their hardiness and cantankerous
personalities.  Dwarves are miners by tradition, working with and
building within the dirt of the earth and stone of the mountains.

Dwarves are shorter than humans and elves, averaging from four and a
half to five and a half feet in height.  They are stocky and rather
powerfully-built, and both males and females proudly wear thick and
often long beards.

Individuals of the race are deceptively quick, but not agile.  Still,
their think and stout frames lend them an uncommon constitution and
strengh, and the race has produced some of the most famed and feared
warriors in the Realms.  Dwarves may become accomplished magic users,
but they are more suited to physical roles.  They are &Gresistant to
flame&w, and generations of working with and within the earth has
fostered their infravision.

Dwarves gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 0.97.  The dwarven
nation lies in the canyons northeast of the great western lake.
~

-1 NANNY_ELF~
&wTall, slender creatures with an affinity for the woods and nature, Elves
were one of the First Three - the three original races fashioned and
scattered across the Realms.

Most elves stand taller than most humans, being six feet and often well
over that in height.  They tend to be fair-skinned with long, straight
hair, although there are individuals who choose a darker life which is
reflected in their outward appearance.

Elves are lighter-framed than humans, but what they lack in strength and
stamina is made up for with their superior agility - both in thought and
movement.  They are capable in all classes, though they function poorest
in the role of pure fighter.  Most will prefer to stay close to nature,
and many become druids.  All elves have the inherent &Gability to detect
magic &win the world around them, and are &Gresistant to cold.&w

Elves gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 1.1.  The Elf nation
lies on the island of Irrybis.
~

-1 NANNY_GITH~
&wThe Gith are a race descended from humans.  Once long ago they were a
peaceful civilization of humans that were captured by mind flayers and
tormented for centuries.  Eventually, a savior named Gith led them to
freedom, yet their bodies had been flayed by the mental powers of the
illithids.  The Gith found themselves stronger, quicker, luckier and
smarter than average humans, yet they had lost much of their faith,
wisdom, stamina and charisma.
 
They are yellow-skinned and very long of limb.  Sunken eyes peer from
yellowed sockets, now strangely capable of &Gnaturally detecting the
invisible&w.  The Gith race has split into three distinct groups:  the
good (Githzerai), the selfish neutral (Pirates of Gith) and the evil
(the Githyanki).
 
Gith gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 1.06.
~

-1 NANNY_GNOME~
&wGnomes are a quirky demi-human race.  Though not the mightiest of
races, they are well versed in their studies of knowledges, magics
and religions.  Most often prefer an evening at home with a magical
tome, a loaf of pipeweed bread and a cup of ale over venturing out
to battle.

Most gnomes are short and stocky, similar to their dwarven cousins.
They usually focus in the magical or clerical arts, though a few
rogues have ventured into the arts of thieving (albeit often not
very well).

Gnomes have &Ginnate infravision&w, and due to their familiarity with
magical and religious lore they are &Gable to detect magic&w in the
environment around them.  They are somewhat &Gresistant to energy&w
based magic, but also somewhat &Gsusceptible to fire&w.

Gnomes gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 1.2.
~

-1 NANNY_HALF-ELF~
&wThese beautiful creatures are the result of the mixing of human and Elven
blood in ages past, and have so freely intermingled in the open societies
of the Realms since their inception that their mixed heritage is of no
consequence.

Though not as tall as the pure Elf, they are nevertheless a rather tall
race ranging from five feet six inches to six feet five inches in height.
They additionally carry a slightly more musculature build than the pure
Elf.

Though the half-elf is not as intelligent as the pure-blooded Elf, nor as
hardy as the full-blooded human, this mix serves quite well in a variety of
classes which require the standards of both mental and physical prowess.
The beautiful almond eyes of the half-elf enable them to &Gdiscern objects
in the darkness&w, and they have an inherent &Gresistance to cold&w.

Half-Elves gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 1.04.
~

-1 NANNY_HALF-OGRE~
&wThe half-ogre is a result of forced breeding in the dark time
with humans, when pure-blooded Ogres were known for raping and
looting human villages.  Like other half-breeds, the half-ogre
was shunned by the full-blooded Ogre race and eventually loosely
assimilated with the human civilizations in the lands surrounding
New Darkhaven.

Half-ogres stand roughly upright, range from six to almost nine
feet height, and even females generally pack well over 300 pounds
on their immense frames.  Most are relatively hairless, and their
bodies are instead covered with small, boney growths.  Their
disproportionately long limbs lend a somewhat simian appearance.
 
Half-ogres inherit great physical abilities:  an good aptitude for
aggression, inherent &Ginfravision&w to assist in travel through
darkness, and though smaller than pure-bred Ogres the half-ogre
nevertheless boasts &Gawesome strength&w.  All in all, the race is
best-suited for the role of pure fighter.
 
Half-ogres gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 0.92.
The half-ogre nation lies at Opallinoc in the northern plains.
~

-1 NANNY_HALF-ORC~
&wA recent mingling of Orcish and Human blood arising as the darker races
have encroached further upon the remaining settled areas, most members
of this half-blooded race are distinctly more Orcish than Human in both
appearance and behavior.

Though not as broad nor powerful as full-blood Orcs, Half-Orcs usually
retain their wider bodies, longer, bowed limbs and heavier musculature.
A ridged brow crowned by bushy eyebrows conceals small, squinting eyes;
below a snout-like noses opens a maw filled with crooked fangs; dark
skin emanating a rancid odor; their presence disgusts civilized races.

Large and dull of wit, with broad bodies, their poor mental and physical
dexterity is offset by an iron constitution.  Though some have dabbled in
the sorcerous arts due to their human influence, brute combat is still
the natural call which stirs in the soul of the Half-Orc.  All Half-Orcs
possess &Ginfravision&w, and most stand from five to seven feet tall and
averaging two hundred pounds.  An altogether fearsome race.
 
Half-Orc's gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 0.94.
~

-1 NANNY_HALF-TROLL~
&wAn intermingling (carried out in the darker lands of the Realms) of the
blood of the Troll with that of Humans, the Half-troll is as deadly as
it is hideous.  Though considerably smaller than full-blood Trolls, the
Half-troll often stands well over eight feet in height and carries over
three hundred pounds on its heavily-muscled frame.
 
Owing in part to the black blood which courses through their heavy veins,
the heavily-scaled skin of the Half-troll ranges in color from a charcoal
grey to a deep, blackish green.  Half-trolls revel in the fright of their
appearance, often wearing their hair in battle-braids and emblazoning
themselves with brands and tattoos to accentuate the effect.
 
Though naturally of low wisdom, the race was sorcerously imbued with a
wicked intelligence and the ability to &Gsee naturally in the darkness.&w
Half-trolls usually make poor pure magic users, and suffer from an
unusually low dexterity.  Yet their boundless energy and high intellect
create one of the most cunning physical beasts of the Realms in
experienced hands.  Half-trolls are &Gall but immune to most poisons.&w

Half-Trolls gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 0.90.
~

-1 NANNY_HALFLING~
&wStout, round, open-minded and very elusive the Hobbit has a level of
dexterity which is only equal to his wit.  Many enjoy the thrill of
reading a good book, or telling stories by the fire.  Many halflings,
because of this, tend to avoid adventuring, though some rare hobbits
choose the path of the Bard, or storyteller, for their keen intellect
serves them well.  This intelligence, coupled with a surprising
determination makes them a curious (though somewhat underpowered)
ally.

Individuals have compact bodies and thick, long limbs, and usually have
very hairy feet.  Eye colors range from blue to brown to green, and
any shade inbetween.

Halflings have an &Ginnate ability to detect evil&w around them, as
well as uncanny &Gability to sneak&w unseen.

Halflings gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 1.02.
~

-1 NANNY_HUMAN~
&wIn the beginning the gods created Humans, Elves and Ogres.  Among
them humans thrived and became the most prolific, and they remain
the most numerous and varied race in the Realms.

Humans are bipeds with upright stances, and while some are larger
the majority stand between five and a-few-inches-under six feet in
height.  There is great variance in their weight, as well as hair,
eye and skin color; it is rare to that any two look exactly alike.

Humans have no inborn predisposition to any alignment or class path.
As a highly adaptable race with no inherent strengths or weaknesses,
they are able to assume and the role of virtually any class.

In the dark time, humans were mated sometimes by choice with elves
(the half-elf), and often by force with ogres (the half-ogre), orcs
(the half-orc) and trolls (the half-troll).
 
Humans have no experience penalties or bonuses, and make their home
in the city of New Darkhaven.
~

-1 NANNY_LIZARDMAN~
&wLizardmen are semi-aquatic, breathing air but often dwelling totally
underwater.  They are often noted to use underwater caves as their
lair, and are typically found in swamps, marshes, and similar places.

Members of this race band together in rough tribal form; they are
omnivores, and are likely to prefer human flesh to other foods.
Due to this taste for humans, they suffer if their alignment strays
too much towards the honorable side of the spectrum.

The race, of course, has the &Ginnate ability to breath under water&w
and is additionally &Gresistant to slashing attacks&w.

Lizard men gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 0.91.  The
lizard man nation currently lies in one of the marsh regions, but
the race is dying and may one day vanish from the Realms.
~

-1 NANNY_MAGE~
The mage is ultimately a being of pure magic, boasting by far the
sharpest minds retaining knowledge of some of the Realms' most
powerful spells.

The novice mage begins with a weak body, but as they grow in knowledge,
experience and power they become a powerful fighting force armed with
an arsenal of spells.  Their vast repertoire makes them a sought after
commodity in the Realms, for their spells can mean victory or defeat
for others.

Mages are not adept at physical combat, and prefer to use small weapons
such as daggers or small swords.
~

-1 NANNY_NEPHANDI~
Nephandi are a dark necromancer/mage blend symbolizing all that is
corrupt, destructive and evil.  They worship only evil and believe
in the Triad of the Wyld, Weaver and Wyrm. Nephandi seek to spread
damnation, disease, poison and death on their way to eating your
very soul.

Due to their inherent nature, they must keep a negative alignment.
Nephandi relish in fire and chaos and abhor all good.
~

-1 NANNY_PALADIN~
Paladins are warrior priests who draw their power from acts of righteousness
and strict adherence to the Code of The Temple of Solomon.  Their strength
in battle, combined with the ability to perform limited miracles, is offset
by the difficulty they experience in perfecting their craft -- and the
penalties they suffer when they stray from the path of good.
~

-1 NANNY_PIXIE~
&wPixies are small Elven creatures with gossamer wings, introduced to the
Realms at some point between the First Three and the later races.
Individuals are extremely slight of stature, standing only a few feet in
height at most.  Both their skin and hair color varies from among all of
the colors of the rainbow.

Pixies are very much more intelligent than most other races, but their
strength and constitution suffers from their small size.  Because of this,
the Pixie often choose the calling of magic and excels especially in the
arts of the Mage; the mind of the Pixie knows no equal.  Pixies possess
the obvious &Gability of flight&w, and are &Gsusceptible to blunt force
attacks&w.

Pixies gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 1.08.
~

-1 NANNY_RANGER~
A ranger is the outdoorsman and adventuresome free spirit of the times.
 
A self-sufficient person, the ranger is adaptable and can survive in
almost any locale.  Skilled with weapons and able to utilize some of the
finest armor available, a ranger is physically skilled enough to take on
most any foe.  However, for especially hardy opponents, a ranger may also
avail himself of useful spells to both hinder his opponent and aid himself.

From minor curative magics to blinding his enemy, the ranger is the most
adept class at surviving on its own.  A ranger typically travels light, but
he does have the mighty strength of a warrior to carry equipment needed in
his travels.  Like the druid (the class other than warrior that he most
closely resembles), his need for help from outside sources is low.
~

-1 NANNY_SEA-ELF~
&wAlso called Aquatic Elves, they are akin to mermen as land elves are
akin to men.  Found almost exclusively among heavy weed beds in quiet,
sheltered, salty waters, they are great friends of the dolphins.  The
race historically prefers to fashion caverns in lagoon bottoms and
reefs in which to live and work, but the reality of the today's Realms
has forced them into the general populace.

The race is humanoid in appearance, with gill slits on the throat and
greenish-silver skin and green or blue-green hair.  Sea elves have an
&Ginnate ability to find magical auras&w as well as the &Ginherent
capacity to breathe underwater&w and a &Gresistance to cold&w.
 
Sea-elves gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 1.12
~

-1 NANNY_THIEF~
The thief is a dark character which makes use of many skills often deemed
... improper by the rest of society.

The skills of the thief reflect his way of life, be it sneaking, peeking
into others' inventories, picking locks, or attacking from behind with
deadly backstabs.  With amazing dexterity they have the ability to circle
around an enemy to deliver devastating blows.

But for living such a dark life, thieves have always had a bad reputation
so don't be suprised if you are always under suspicion.

Thieves start off fairly weak, but as they gain skills such as backstab and
circle they soon become dangerous foes.  A thief is always useful when there
is a lock that needs to be pried, an item that one wishes to acquire without
detection, or a particularly wicked foe whose downfall requires cunning.
~

-1 NANNY_VAMPIRE~
Vampires are one of the powerful creatures of the Realms.  Being a
creature of the undead, they require copious quantities of fresh
blood.  Instead of using mana, Vampires use blood points (bp) for
spell casting and some skill use.

If a Vampire takes a large amount of damage, blood points will be
lost, but blood points can give a small surge of hit points (hp) in
battle when needed.

As an undead creature of the night, Vampires receive an armor class
(ac) bonus at night, a time when they can use the skill mistwalk to
travel across vast stretches of the Realms in an instant.
~

-1 NANNY_WARRIOR~
Warriors are the quintessential fighters, able to use all types of
weaponry and armour in the exercise of their most lethal of combat
skills.  There is no greater physical combatant.

A warrior must be strong in body to survive his dangerous lifestyle,
and though he has no magic and limited skills he is nevertheless one
of the most formidable forces in all the Realms.

Warriors learn no magic, and have no use for mana.
~

1 'NATION COUNCILS'~
.  Basically, the Council Positions in a Nation depend greatly on the Leader
and the Nation itself.  There are, however, a few basic positions that each
Nation should have.  Position names can, of course, be altered to suit the
Nation.  Each council should consist of 3-5 people of any level.

Ambassador - The Ambassador is a vital part of any Nation.  S-he is responsible
             for the maintenance of internations relations and any commuication
             between Nations.

WarLord    - The WarLord, also known occasionally as the BattleMaster, is the
             Nation's fiercest and most experienced fighter.  S-he is the one
             responsible for organizing monster runs in which the Nation
             participates.

Second     - The Second is, in effect, the Leader's apprentice.  S-he should
             always be prepared to step into the Leader's shoes in case the
             Leader should meet an untimely demise or have to leave the Nation.

Scout      - The Scout is the one who seeks out possible Nation members and
             recruits them.  The Scout should always be fully aware of the
             Nation's rules, policies and procedures so they may be conveyed
             to the recruit.

1 NATIONS~
Nations has been set up as a venue for role playing throughout the Realms.
A visit to the City of Darkhaven will reveal the Realms of Despair is truly
multi-national. It's not unusual to see a troll grunting at a pixie who is
flying over a human, or to see an ogre and orc communing over a mug
of beer. Halfling and Giths may be seen sharing conversations with Dwarves,
Elves and Half-Elves..as long as there is peace in the land. Each race
has its own government complete with war councils. The government provides
quests and holds Nation summits to discuss international matters. Each
race speaks its' own language on the racetalk channel. 
 
The Nations came into being due to the efforts of the immortal Phalanx, in
April of 1997.

1 'NEW DARKHAVEN'~
Darkhaven, famed City of Hope, lies in the center of Despair's main
continent. The city has never fallen to the forces of Darkness and remains
one of Light's most fervent defenders. In fact, the greatest adventurers
of Despair originate from Darkhaven, certainly profiting from the Academy's
excellent teaching. The Darkhaven markets are always filled with objects
of wonder, and anyone wishing to join one of Despair's ten guilds will
certainly want to visit the City of Hope, for the guild halls are located
there.
~

1 'NEW OFCOL'~
Recommended level range: 5 - 35

The city of New Ofcol has grown so in recent years that it has been
reunited with its cousin, Ofcol. Now known under the common name
of Ofcol, the two cities form to make one of Light's stoutest defenders.
Guided by an ancient golden dragon and the Priestess of Ofcol and led by
Marshall Diana, the city's soldiers are feared by many of the darker races.
The only downside is the city's position. Located far to the northeast of
the Plains of the North, if any of the other cities of Light came under
attack, Ofcol would have great difficulty in sending aid quickly...
~

1 'NEW THALOS~
Recommended level range: 5 - 35

After the bloody destruction of Thalos, all of the citizens who had
survived banded together to create New Thalos. Far to the east of the city
of Darkhaven and north of the Ishtar river, the city stands to this day.
The Great Eastern desert lies to the south and if you are far enough east,
you can hear the tranquil waves of the Sea of Sorrows lapping against the
shore. New Thalos is one of the five great cities that dares to oppose the
forces of Darkness. Several shops attract many tourists from far away.
The Sultan of New Thalos has joined with Darkhaven and other cities in a
wholehearted effort to oppose the forces of Evil.

Syntax: newbieset <character>

NEWBIESET puts the default (i.e. Darkhaven Academy) equipment into the

~

25 'NEWCLAN APPLICATIONS'~
In all cases new clan applications would be taken the old way:
 
 - you find your three leaders (no shared leaders here)

 - you find at least two additional avatars
   ... need five avatars total start clan (3 leaders, 2 more)

 - your theme is approved by the conclave; approval is defined
   here as little more than a straining process for quality.
   If you have a theme you're willing to build on/around and
   play and it's not something like a clan that fights for the
   glory of Metallica you're probably okay
 
- you find a deity that's willing to help you in upkeeping
   the clan (i.e. be a mediator with other imms, help you get
   changes made, help you keep the theme of your clan going).
   You won't _have_ to have a deity all the time if it just
   really ends up that you can't keep one, but it's necessary
   to get started (though have pondered linking the function
   of certain clan bonuses such as healers, etc. to the clan
   having a deity, but that's a completely different matter)

NOTE:  This isn't to say an imm-created clan or clans may not be
       introduced, but any such clans would have stipulations on
       them and be for specific use, such as any assassin type of
       clan.  This isn't being planned, just covering bases here
~

50 'NEWCLAN EQ1'~
Equipment option 1:  divinated
 
Created the same as the current system - three items of differing
level that are powered up from a pool of stats.  A full set of eq
may give 18 damroll and 90hps total, for example.

NOTE:  Eq _will_ be lower power overall than current equipment
~

50 'NEWCLAN EQ2'~
Equipment option 2:  self-created
 
Created via purchase by the clan.  Either gold or glory or both used
to add affects to the items up to a cap.  Items would start off with
no affects, or perhaps a very, very low set of base stats
 - cap would be raised occasionally to allow more power to be added
   if stock item power overtakes it
   NOTE:  There are new areas coming in that are going to have stock
          items better than existing stock items, and some will have
          items that give unusual rewards.  The difficulty will be
          astronomical, but the value is pretty high
 
Affects could also be removed and replaced at the will of the clan
(i.e. adjusting the item for a cost, remove hps and add some dr, etc.)
or even stripped completely by the clan I suppose if it really wanted
to screw everyone up who had their stuff.
 -  changes to affects could either be retroactive or new eq only,
    meaning when you change a bracer every bracer out there would
    receive that change, or that change would only affect new items
    made.  This is something that would be decided at inception.
 
Yes, cost would be high for affects, and we have not decided on a scale
yet.  It's very unlikely that even the existing clans could foot the
bill for a set of eq comparable even to old clan stuff in a short time.
It's meant that it'll be a slower process, though I'm sure someone will
surprise us.  The advantages are a rising cap over time, the control to
adjust stats as you want and can afford, and that the eq will likely
be more powerful when capped than the divinated eq would be.
~

51 'NEWCLAN HQ1'~
Building option 1:  build-and-maintain
 
Similar to current system - you (or whoever you recruit to build it for
you if you don't know how to build) build it on the building node, then
it is checked to ensure it complies with basic guidelines (approximately
20 rooms maximum, no 15k stunning guards, etc.) and finally it's ported
to this node where occasional updates are made (to reflect leadership
changes, etc.)  In short, build it and forget about it.

Advantages vs clan-financed hqs:  no cost to clan to build

Disadvantages vs clan-financed hqs:  smaller, no bank, weaker guardians,
less favorable shop costs (possibly less favorable shops period), no
changes other than changes to leader references and programs or changes
deemed necessary by the Conclave
~

51 'NEWCLAN HQ2'~
Build option 2:  clan-financed
 
Similar to equipment option 2.  The clan finances its own hq, paying for
rooms, guardians, storage facility, shop and shop items, clan bank,
portal, healer, channel, etc.  Start small and build, or re-shape your
hq at will (as with equipment, for a cost).  

Advantages vs build-and-maintain option:  hq can be larger and can be
adjusted within guidelines, can adjust guardian capabilities (again,
within guidelines) and guardians will generally be more powerful.  More
favorable shop prices and more items available for sale potentially.
Clan bank and anything else new available only to clan-financed hqs.

Disadvantages vs build-and maintain option:  expensive

...Everything begins to fade to black.  You feel yourself leaving your body.
Rising up into the air, you feel more free than you have ever felt before...
 
However, before your deity comes to collect your soul, you feel a strange
pulling sensation as strange and colorful mists swirl around you...
 
&CA low voice fills your head with words of advice...
"When your character dies, you are reincarnated at the cathedral of Notre
 Dame de Sioux in New Darkhaven; should you one day become a member of a
 clan, guild or order you will be returned to your own altar."
 
"Your corpse, however, is left behind where you were killed, together with
 all of your equipment, so that you can attempt to return to the scene and
 loot your corpse.  Your gold stays with you.  Corpses decay after time,
 and when this happens the objects inside will decay with it."
 
"Once you have chosen a deity and gained sufficient favor, you may be able
 to supplicate to your deity for your corpse.  Type '&Whelp death&C' for more
 information.  This message will appear only on your first two deaths..."

1 NOMINIS UMBRAE 'NOMINIS UMBRAE'~
In the dark, shadowy alleyways and corners of the Realms lurk the Nominis
Umbrae, a dangerous, chaotic cult.  Having spent a nearly endless amount of 
time in study of The Void, or "The Shadow", as they often call it, they
proclaim their endless devotion to it.  Much like shadows "create" and
"destroy" things simply by moving and revealing or obscuring them, so the
Nominis Umbrae belive the void acts, revealing and obscuring ideas, people,
places, and even entire civilizations within a murky black grip.
 
Their beliefs hold that The Void calls for the recycling of blood back into the
Earth in order to create new life.  Further, they believe that while this is
a natural cycle that will complete itself on its own, that they can usher the
process along more quickly by increasing the flow, and will be rewarded by
The Void with high-priest positions within this newly-created world.  As their
sacred texts' predictions of the End of Days begin to align with the celestial
calendar of their sacred monument, they have begun to appear in full force to 
the point where sightings of them carrying out their gruesome tasks while 
chanting prayer "In the name of The Shadow" have become common enough to have 
earned them their nickname.

51 NOSFERATU~
.
This city is afraid of me. I have seen its true face. The streets are
extended gutters and the gutters are full of blood and when the drains
finally scab over, all the vermin will drown.
                                               
A Treatise on the Probable Origins and Physical Anomalies of Subspecies
                       Homo Sapiens Nosferatus

The Year of our Lord, 1897
By Claudius Maximus, Clan Tremere.
 
Do not the Nosferatu share the ability of the Gangrel to establish a rapport
with the lower denizens of the planet? Verily, I have seen a Nosferatu
crouched low amid her sewer haven, staring into a great rat's eyes for
fully an hour. I believe that they have more in common with such creatures
than with the humans from whom they have so tragically devolved.
In any event, it is indisputable that whatever crime the Nosferatu
forefather committed has been at least partially expiated upon the flesh
of his progeny. While the Embrace for most of us is a blessed gift,
endowing us with the boon of immortality and the elixir of potency, the
Nosferatu are instead twisted and disfigured beyond human ken by the 
transferal of vitae.
The Nosferatu, whether due to their horrid disfigurement or some other
as yet unknown factor, are to a vampire graceless and crude. The refinements
of the higher clans seem lost on them. Even their brute strength, which
occassionally proves useful, is perverted by their brutishness.
Nonetheless, a certain low cunning pervades the Nosferatu. The clan- for
we of the Camarilla go so far as to grant the Nosferatu equal status in
hopes of bettering the hapless race - is infamous for its ability to garner
and compile data of all sorts. I believe this penchant to be instinctual
rather than premeditated, rather like bower-birds adorning their nests with
all manner of gaudy debris. A Nosferatu overhears a half understood snippet of
information or gossip, and then parrots it amongst his own kind, without--
 
[The manuscript was never finished, and, indeed, seemed to be interrupted
in progess by the untimely Final Death of Claudius Maximus. Our esteemed
peer was discovered in his sanctum, strapped to his own dissecting table.
It was evident that the instruments of Maximus' death were his own magical
instruments. No positive identification of the perpetrators could be found,
but, scrawled on the laboratory wall in a fluid that Thaumaturgic examination
has proven to be Maximus' own vitae was the message
 
I AM NOT AN ANIMAL. I AM SOMETHING MUCH WORSE!
 
Of all the Kindred, the Nosferatu are perhaps the most alien. Other
vampires can walk amidst the mortal crowns and thus maintain at least an
intermittent grasp on their former species. Not so the Nosferatu. They
must lurk below, their view of the mortals filtered by sewer bars.

51 NOSUPPLICATE NOSUPP~

51 'NOTE COPY'~
&YSYNTAX: &Wnote copy #
&w

it in your inventory. Type note copy and the number of the note
from note/mail list.
~

1 NOTE NOTES~
USAGE - 'note (command) [number or text]'
   (command) can be any of the following:
     List, Read, Write, Subject, To, Show, Post, Remove, Take, Date,
    or Reply.
   [number or text] can be left blank, be a number, or be words
    depending on what (command) you use.  Usage is explained below.

LIST - Lists the notes you can read. List [number] lists all the notes
 including, and after [number]. You must be at a note board to List.
 example: 'note list'    shows all notes on the board.
          'note list 10' shows notes 10 and later on the board.

READ - Displays the contents of [number]. You must be at a note board to
 Read, and you must specify a [number].
 example: 'note read 5' displays note #5.

WRITE - Puts you in an editor where you can write a note. You must be
 holding a note, and have a quill in your inventory to Write.
 example: 'note write' puts you in the editor. See Help EDITOR.
 
 
Also see Help &Wnote2, &wHelp &Wnote3, &wHelp &Wvote &wand Help &Weditor&w.
~

1 NOTE2~
SUBJECT - Sets the subject line of a new note to [text]. You must be
 holding a note, and have a quill in your inventory to set the Subject.
 example: 'note subject Hello World!' sets Hello World! as the subject.

TO - Sets the recipient(s) to [text]. ALL means all players. IMMORTAL
 means all immortals. You must be holding a note, and have a quill.
 example: 'note to Harakiem' sets Harakiem as the note's recipient.

SHOW - displays a note you are holding.
 example: 'note show' displays the note you're holding.

POST - takes a note you're holding and posts it to the board you are at,
 so others may read it.
 example: 'note post' puts it on the board.

REMOVE - erases note [number] from a note board. You must be at a note
 board and be the note's author or an immortal to use Remove.
 example: 'note remove 12' removes note #12, if you're its author.
 
TAKE - similar to 'Remove' but places the note in your inventory, rather
 than completely erasing it.
 example: 'note take 10' moves note 10 to your inventory from the board.

DATE - similar to 'list' but replaces who the message is to with the
 date that the note was written.
 
Also see Help &Wnote, &wHelp &Wnote3, &wHelp &Wvote &wand Help &Wediting&w.
~

1 NOTE3~
REPLY - starts a reply note to the original sender with the subject.
  (It addresses the note to the original sender with the same subject)
  Example: 'note reply 12' replies to the sender of note 12.
 
Also see Help &Wnote, &wHelp &Wnote2, &wHelp &Wvote &wand Help &Wediting&w.
~

51 NOTELL NOEMOTE NOTITLE SILENCE UNSILENCE~
Syntax: notitle <character>
Syntax: noemote <character>
Syntax: notell  <character>
Syntax: silence <character>
Syntax: unsilence <character>
 
NOTITLE, NOEMOTE, NOTELL, and SILENCE are used to muffle other characters, by
preventing them from setting their title, emoting, telling, and using
channels, respectively. Characters who are notelled will also not receive
those forms of communication.

For all of the above punishments, particularly notitle and noemote, please
make sure you speak the person before using the punishment.

Use UNSILENCE to remove a player's silence. Simply use notell, noemote or
notitle on the character again to remove each of those restrictions.

57 'NUISANCE STAGES'~
Stages of nuisances are the affects that the victim picks up while in
that stage.  As time progresses and the victim progresses through the
stages, they pick up new problems and the old ones gradually strengthen.
So for example if they are in stage 3 and progress to stage 4.  They
will feel more affects from stage 1,2 and 3 and pick up the affects from
stage 4. Power level is how hard they get hit with the affect. So if in stage
1 the affect was 2% of the time at power level 1 it may be 4% of the time
in power level 2.  And in stage 2 the affect in stage 1 may be 4% of the
time at power level 1 and 8% of the time at power level 2.
So with that being said here are the current stages and their affects:
Stage 1:  The Thirst Stage 
          This makes them become thirsty quicker.  The formula used is the
following: <current stage>*<power level> for how much more is added to your
following: <current stage>*<power level> for how much more is subtracted from
your thirst each time.  With 100 being not thirsty and 0 being dehydrated.
Stage 2:  The Hunger Stage
          The hunger stage works exactly as above except, the formula
subtracts 1 from the current stage becoming: (<current stage>-1)*<power level>
Stage 3:  The Mentalstate Stage
          In this stage each time your mentalstate worsens nuisance exagerates
the amount you worsen by. The formula used to compute how much more it 
adds or subtracts is: .4*(<current stage>-2)*<power level>.
Stage 4:  The Potion Stage
          In this stage you can not stomach as many potions as you normally
could without the nuisance flag.  Normally if your thirst or hunger is above
48 you can't quaf anymore.  Nuisance makes this a much lower number.
The formula used is: (48-(3*<current stage>)+<power level>)
So at power level 10, stage 10 you could only quaf 8 potions on an empty
stomach.
Stage 5:  The Wait Stage
          In this stage commands start taking longer to complete.  A
normal spell for example takes around 8-15 rounds of wait time.  With this
stage more wait time is added with the following formula:
(<current stage> -4 ) + <power level>    So at Stage 6 at power level 5,
each command would have an additionl 7 wait added to it.
Stage 6:  The Offensive Magic Stage
           In this stage you have a chance of targeting yourself with 
offensive spells instead of whatever target is specified.  The formula
for the percentage or the time you do it is the following:
(<current stage>-5)*8 + <power_level>*6  So at first stage 6 with a power
level of 5 you would have a 38% chance to target yourself with offensive
spells.
Stage 7:  The Defensive Magic Stage
          In this stage, if you are fighting someone you have a chance to
target them with any defensive spells you cast.  The formula used is the
following:  (<current stage>-6)*8 + <power_level>*6

57 'NUISANCE STAGES2'~
Stage 8:  The Speech Stage
          In this stage you have a chance to scramble your speech and
scramble other peoples speech (IE what you hear from them).  This works
on a percentage with the following formula:
(<current stage>-7)*10*<power level>  So at stage 9 with power level 2
speech is scrambled 40% of the time.
Stage 9:  The Movement Stage
            In this stage you start moving in random directions like a drunk
does.  This is worked out in a percentage as well. Which works of the 
following formula:  (<current stage>-8)*10*<power level>  So in stage 10
with a power level of 4 you would randomly choose an exit 80% of the time.
Stage 10:  The command Stage
           In this stage your commands start failing (Like mentalstate).
This is done on a percentage of the following:
(<current stage>-9)*10*<power level>  So at stage 10, power level 10 the
character becomes utterly useless, as commands will fail 100% of the time.
Soon there will be more options, when they come in the help files you should

57 NUISANCE UNNUISANCE~
&WSyntax:
      &cunnuisance  <victim>
      &cnuisance    <victim> [options]
&GUnnuisance will remove the nuisance flag from a player.
Nuisance will add a nuisance flag to the player specified by victim.
&wThis only works on pc's.  The optional parameters are as follows:
  &cmaxtime <#> <minutes/days/hours>&w
         &wThe maxstage of nuisance. Default is 8 days.
  &ctime <#>&w:  The time in days that the nuisance flag will stay on the
         player, once the time is expired the flag will automatically be
         removed. If this option is not used it will default to a permenant
         penalty.
  &cpower <#>&w:  A number from 1 to 10, 10 being the worst for the player.

&WNote the words before the options are not optional and must be used.

&RExamples:  &cnuisance mortal maxtime 5 days time 7 power 5
&GThis would nuisance mortal for 7 days with the maximum stage being
reached in 5 days, at a power level of 5.  Also note you can leave options
out:  &cnuisance mortal maxtime 5 days power 5 &Gfor example would set the
maximum time to reach the final stage at a power level 5 and use the default
value for the time.  Also options can be rearranged n like:
&cnuisance mortal power 5 maxtime 5 days time 7 &Gwould be the same as the
first example.

53 OBJECTRESISTANCE~
The resistance of an object against a pull/push force is determined by the
weight of an object and a few quick math formulas.
 
The base resistance of an object is equal to its weight. If an object is 
flagged "metal" it gets an initial addition of 1/5th its weight. The 
resistances then become based off the item type
 
For scrolls, notes and trash divide the resistance by 4.
For scraps and containers, divide the resistance by 2.
For pens and quills, multiply the resistance by 5/6.
For mob and pc corpses and fountains, multiply the resistance by 4.
 
If the absolute value (+/- 100 = 100) of the push value multiplied by 10 is
greater than the resistance of the object, the object will eventually be moved
by the pull/push force.

1 OBJECTS~
To see the objects you currently possess, type INVENTORY and EQUIPMENT>
INVENTORY is the items you are carrying, but are not currently wearing.
EQUIPMENT shows you the equipment you are currently wearing.
 
You may WEAR, WIELD, or HOLD equipment to use it.  To stop using a piece
of equipment, you REMOVE it.  Before you may wield a new weapon, you must
first REMOVE the old weapon. 
 
You can gain information on your objects by using LOOK or EXAMINE.  EXAMINE
tells you the condition of your item, as a more detailed form of LOOK.
 
To find out more information on objects, read sections 9, 10 and 17 of your

1 'OCEAN KEEP'~
Recommended level range: 20 - 50

The city of Ocean Keep borders the Ocean of Storms, a sea whose waves
are in perpetual furor and whose skies are always dark. Ruled by the
Lord and Lady Willem, the city is a thriving seaport where justice
and peace rule. However, tales of pirates under the leadership of a
man named Faragut have been running wild, and it seems there is more
to the 'peace' in Ocean Keep than meets the eye.
~

1 OCKWATER 'OCKWATER FENS'~
&RRecommended level range:&w 10 - 25

As the tribal culture of the lizardmen grew and expanded into into new
realms, it eventually came into contact with these realms. In these
ancient times, there had been very little contact between the lizardmen
and other races. The early explorers amongst the lizardmen set up a camp
at the edge of the marshes they had crossed, beneath the mountains which
had kept the cultures apart. A plentiful fishing ground with clean water,
the camp thrived and became a tiny settlement which is still home to a
few generations of lizardmen today. Well hidden beneath the peat moss
and watched over by many scouts and warriors, the small community has
flourished as the lizardmen and other races have grown together.

+silent argument allows you to remove the item without the victim seeing
you do so.

1 'OCTOPUS GARDEN'~
.The chair creaked as the old man rocked back in it, groaning to himself.
"Nay, Olaf, Nay" said the venerable Captain Pryce, "'Tis a wondrous ale
you brew, lad.  'Tis only my mind playing tricks on me again, it happens
when ye get to be my age..."
 The fire popped and sputtered to itself as the old sailor scrubbed at his
chin through his scraggled gray beard, his brow furrowing of it's own
accord as the memories came flooding back to him.
 "T'was a night of horrendous storms," he began, "I knew I shouldn't have
left port, but the Duke was insistent. He had to have his cursed wines!"
"Pah!" he exclaims, slamming his fist into the table, "The fool knows
nothing of the sea and it's foul moods!" His gaze falls across the scarred
leather cup that hides the stump where his left hand should be, "Blast me!
I should've heeded the signs, but I braved the sea, the storms...then the
beast took us!  The BEAST! It took me poor Golden Lady like she was
cuddling a child to it's breast...and then it ripped us apart!  The lads
tried to save us, but the beast was too strong. It shrugged off our bolts
like annoying gnats. I saw young Langdon dragged off and broke like a
child's toy by one of the beast's sinuous arms...big around as oxen they
were! And as if the Fates hadn't had enough, those blasted fish-men came
scrabbling over my bow while the beast held us fast, and killed any they
could catch. Lucky for me, a few of the lads managed to scramble into a
dingy before my poor Lady went under...lotta fine mates went with 'er." 
Sighing reluctantly to himself, the Captain went back to his ale...
~

1 OFCOL~
Recommended level range: 1 - 50

The original city of Ofcol has grown so in recent years that it has
been reunited with its cousin, New Ofcol. Now known under the name
of Ofcol, the two cities form to make one of Light's stoutest defenders.
Guided by an ancient golden dragon and the Priestess of Ofcol and led
by Diana, the city's soldiers are feared by many of the darker races. The
only downside is the city's position. Located far to the northeast of the
Plains of the North, if any of the other cities of Light were to come under
attack, Ofcol would have great difficulty in sending aid quickly...
~

1 'OGRE VILLAGE'~
Long ago, before the threats of Shimmergloom, Orcus or Lord Seth, the
barbaric ogres waged war against our ancestors. With their strange
shamans and fearsome strength and size, the ogres were often able
to destroy the smaller villages of Despair. Many years of war passed,
and the ogre population slowly dwindled, until only a handful of them
remained. The savage giants retreated to their sole remaining village and
awaited annihilation. However, pity overcame the avatars of Darkhaven
and they asked the mages of the Tower of High Sorcery to ensure that the
ogres lived in peace and no longer meant a threat to the Light. A maze of
mists was woven about the ogre village, simple to solve for any intelligent
race, yet confusing for ogres. The threat of the ogre race ended long ago and
very few visit, or attack, them.

1 'OLD MARSH'~
Recommended level range: 20 - 35

is populated by trolls and other vile beings who enjoy such a climate.
~

1 'OLD THALOS'~
Recommended level range: 1 - 30

Those who travel back in time to see the Tree of Life often encounter
the very beginnings of Thalos, when it was far more powerful than
Darkhaven and was protected by Gordon the Brave, Defender of the
Light. The sights and wonders to see in this city are always too much
to tell by those who witness it, for it is a constant reminder of what has
been lost.

1 OLYMPUS~
Recommended level range: 10 - 50

At the Moment of Treason, the Lost Gods entered Es'Tilith and were
sentenced to an eternity of imprisonment.  To spite the Lost even
further, the Lord of Darkness forged two cities of the Gods, which he
named Olympus and Hades. Weakened forms of some of the Lost Gods
of Good were imprisoned in Olympus, while a number of the Evil Lost were
sentenced to Hades. Though these impersonations act like Gods, they
cannot even come close to matching the power of their true forms trapped
inside Es'Tilith. It has even been possible for these illusions to be killed
by powerful Avatars.

1 OPHANIM~
Originally the "Order of the Pure Blade", a monastic order of knights founded a
few years before the destruction of old Darkhaven, designed with the purpose of
preparing for the End of Days.  Caught unprepared by the apocalyptic wave of
evil that destroyed Old Darkhaven and left the ruins and Gravoc in their place,
the Order was forced to disband under the belief that the evil was simply too
strong to fight with physical force.  Unwavering in his belief that the forces
of the blessed must be present to drive evil away from enacting the End of 
Days, the original Magister of the order secreted away what forces would follow
him into seclusion, where they attempted to mend their wounds, using the name 
of the Order to gain forces.  After a herculean battle with the Forces of 
Darkness that resulted in the death of their Magister, the utter annihilation 
of their headquarters, and the loss of half their numbers, the Order was forced
to once again go into secrecy as well as change their name.
 
Rumors of the Order have once again begun to resurface, devoted to the same
goals, but with a slightly different gameplan.  Ideals have been compromised in
order to survive, as they now accept the help of lesser evils and neutrals
whose own goals conflict with the End of Days.

ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggressive nature (while charmed).

If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm.
~

1 ORDERCREATE~
In order for a new order to be considered, it at the very least, must
have an imm sponsor. New Orders are very rarely accepted and usually
take close to a year to get implemented when they are. As a minimum,
your proposal should include the following:
1) A statement that you have the HQ built on your smaug copy.
2) A history, philosophy, theme for the Order.
3) A list of membership requirements and how members would be accepted.
4) A reason this order is needed.
5) List how it is different from other orders in existence.
6) No new orders requesting equipment will be accepted.
7) The immortal sponsoring the Order will submit proposals.
~

1 ORDERS~

~

54 OSET~
Syntax:  oset <object>    <field> <value>
         oset object on
 
If the copy of the object you are currently modifying has the PROTOTYPE flag,
your modifications will also modify the index of that object, which all other
instances of the object are based on.  In the future, every copy of that obj
will reflect your modifications.
 
Also be aware that modifications to the object affect list (everything that
is listed after 'object values') will affect _every_ copy of that object in
the game, including old copies (even if they are not online).  Thus if you
change a prototype-flagged copy of a sword to +4 damroll, every copy of that
vnum ever made will reflect that change.  If you add a 'magic' flag to that
sword, however, only copies made after the change will be affected.
 
If the copy of the object you are modifying does NOT have the PROTOTYPE flag,
your modifications will affect only that copy.
 
To oset non prototype objects for renames and rekeys: 
oset item name (new name)
oset item short (short desc)
oset item long (long desc)
This will only work on non proto items and is not global.

54 OSETON~
OSET ON will lock you onto a particular object.  Once locked on, all commands
commands will imply 'oset <object>'.  Hitting enter while in OSET ON gives
you an ostat of the object you are working on.  To get out of OSET ON, simply
type the word DONE. Example:
        oset staff on
        long A long gnarled staff of burnished oak lies here.
        type staff
        done
 
~

53 OWHERE~
&WSyntax: owhere <object/keyword/vnum>

&WExample: owhere kid-gloves
&WExample: owhere 10319
 
&GOwhere allows you to search for an item by using its vnum or keywords.
Owhere lists the name of the object, the name of the player or mob carrying
it and the container name (if it is in a container). If the object is
not carried by any mob or player (because it is on the ground or in a
container on the ground) Owhere will display the room name and number.

You can specify an object's vnum as the argument. This will find all
occurrences of that vnum even if the short desc and/or keyword has
been renamed.
 
If the item you are looking for is inside of a container, and carried
by a player(s), the player will be identified with 0 as the vnum in
the center column, and the container's vnum and name of container
in the third column.

~

1 OWNERSHIP~
&r*&B-----------------------------------------------------------------------&r*
 
  &wBesides renames and rekeys, all glory affects to items will only be
  done for the Owner of the object. The first time an item is given to
  an Immortal for an affect to be added, the object will be flagged
  with your name. Once you are established as the Owner of that item,
  it is permanent and will not be changed for any reason, even if the
  item is traded in the future. 
  
  Please be aware of this when trading for items. If you trade for an
  object that has had glory affects added to it, most likely it also
  has an Ownership tag and you will not be able to add anything to the
  item yourself.
 
  Objects in the game that pre-date the Ownership tags will be tagged
  when the next affect to the item is requested, or upon request. Note
  that if you are not adding an affect to the item, the item must be
  rekeyed with your name before an Ownership tag will be added.
 
  This will not affect renames or rekeys, such as gifts you wish to
  make for other people.

The Paladin
___________________________________________________________
"You are the most excellent of men and your lips have been anointed with
grace, since God has blessed you forever.  Gird your sword upon your side,
O mighty one; clothe yourself with splendor and majesty.
 
In your majesty ride forth victoriously in behalf of truth, humility and
righteousness; let your right hand display awesome deeds. 
 
Let your sharp arrows pierce the hearts of the king's enemies; let the
nations fall beneath your feet...
 
You love righteousness and hate wickedness; therefore God, your God, has 
set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy...
 
I will perpetuate your memory through all generations; therefore the
nations will praise you for ever and ever..."
___________________________________________________________
 
Paladins are warrior priests who draw their power from acts of righteousness
and strict adherence to the Code of The Temple of Solomon.  Their strength
in battle, combined with the ability to perform limited miracles is offset
by the difficulty they experience in perfecting their craft, and the penalties
they suffer when they stray from the path of good.
 
The following races are acceptable to the ways of the Paladin:

0 PASSWORD~
Syntax:  password  <new password>   <new password>
 
PASSWORD changes your character's password.  You repeat the new password only.
If you do not get it correctly it will not work.  This should end the typo
locking you out of your character.
The PASSWORD command is protected against being snooped or logged; it is
impossible for any immortal to in any way see, find or retrieve it.  It
is the responsibility of the player to ensure that the password of the
character is kept secure.
 
Passwords can not contain certain characters, or spaces.  We also advise
that you use an alphanumeric password (one containing both numbers and
letters) as they are harder to guess.  We also recommend that you choose
a password that is greater than 6 characters in length.  A good rule of
thumb is if it is in the dictionary, it is probably not a good password.
 
NOTE:  if you decide to trade a character, you do so at your own risk.
Immortals are NOT responsible for ensuring fair trades. The trading of 
characters, equipment etc for real life money is not encouraged and will
not be dealt with by immortals. Beware of any who offer you money.

&YThe password policy is:  password equals ownership.&w
 
See also PASSWORD_ZMUD
~

2 PASSWORD_ZMUD~
When you're using zMUD and want to change your password, remember to change
it in the zMUD character settings as well as on the mud.  The MUD's command
for this is:  password <new password> <new password>
In zMUD, click on 'File', then 'Another Character', or 'File', then 'Open'
to access the character settings - and change the password there.
If you have forgotten your character's password but can still log on with
the character, you can still find out what the password is.  Log on with
that character, click on 'View', then 'Preferences' and then click on
General Settings'.  Find the checkbox for 'Gag Password' and make sure the
box is not checked.  Click on 'Ok' to close the dialog box.
Type the command #say %pass [enter].  Your password will be shown on your
screen, but not sent to the mud.  Write it down, for future reference.

the strong city and its' neighbors. A quasit imp watches over the sylvan
races. Some say it is only a matter of time before these peaceful beings
are utterly destroyed.
 
~

0 PIXIE PIXIES~
Pixies are small Elven creatures with gossamer wings, introduced to the
Realms at some point between the First Three and the later races.
Individuals are extremely slight of stature, standing only a few feet in
height at most.  Both their skin and hair color varies from among all of
the colors of the rainbow.

Pixies are very much more intelligent than most other races, but their
strength and constitution suffers from their small size.  Because of this,
the Pixie often chooses the calling of magic and excels especially in the
arts of the Mage; the mind of the Pixie knows no equal.  Pixies possess
the obvious &Gability of flight&w, and are &Gsusceptible to blunt force
attacks&w.

Pixies can follow the ways of the following classes:
Mage Cleric Thief Ranger Nephandi Druid

Pixies gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 1.08.

Conclave for further review of their idea.

0 POISON~
Syntax: cast poison <victim>

This spell reduces the strength of the victim by two, as well as reducing the
victim's regeneration rate.
 
Being the target of poison is a nasty dilemma.  Poisons cause the 
sufferers body to be wracked with pain and fever, weakening them and 
causing hallucinations in the further stages of affliction.  Many healers 
are said to be proficient in the tending of such conditions, though the 
recovery may still take some time on the part of the sufferer.
~

0 'POISON WEAPON'~
Syntax:  'poison weapon' <weapon>
Abbrev:  poison <weapon>
 
A skill unique to thieves which enables them to coat their weapon with a
deadly poison.  In battle, this poison will cause ill effects on its
recipient.  Be warned however, it has been told that poison has a strong
lessening effect on the lifetime of the weapon poisoned.
 
To poison a weapon you must have the weapon itself, the poisoning powder
and a full waterskin in your inventory.  Your intelligence and wisdom
must both also be relatively high, else you will be unable to complete
the poisoning process until they are raised to a sufficient level.
 
~

1 'POSSESS'~
&YSyntax&W: cast possess <mob>
 
This spell enables you to switch into a mob for a short amount of time.
The spell has the same general restrictions as charming, but costs
much more mana. You will be able to perform many skills/spells that the
mob you have possessed is able to perform, for only as long as you
are the possessor. When you die, you will return to your body.
 
For the duration of your possession of a mobile, you will also be
in possession of its hitpoints, mana, movement, and equipment,
rather than your own. You will also find that exits will not
appear to you automatically, and your scoresheet will be different.
To see exits while you are possessing, simply type "exits" manually.
 
Lastly, keep in mind that mobiles are treated differently from
players in many respects. You may find that you cannot enter some
rooms, or that certain mobiles will behave towards you aggressively,
Luckily, your "human shell" will be unaffected by events which
happen to your possessed mobs, and you can always return.
 
** You must have the heart of a mob in your possession for this spell to 
   work. **

mechanism. If you do not practice it, you will not be able to fire.
 
Lastly, provided you have a projectile in inventory, and a firing
weapon wielded in the 'missile wielded' position, you are ready to
try out your new projectile.
 
Note that firing a weapon at another player will result in a pkill
attempt, which can have severe consequences. If you and your mortal
target are not both listed under "Who Deadly", you will be confronted
by an immortal for your actions and flagged as a violater of Realms
Law. See &YLaws Pkill&W for more information on players vs. players.

0 PROMPT FPROMPT~
Syntax:   prompt  <string>
Syntax:   fprompt <string>
 
Sets your prompt to a given string.  The game automatically sets your prompt 
when your character is created, but you can use PROMPT to change your prompt
to more to your liking.  If you type 'default' as the string, your prompt
will be set back to the game default.
 
The fprompt sets your fighting prompt.  This is the prompt that is displayed
to you while you are fighting.  It follows the same format as the normal
prompt does.
Your prompt can be any string of characters that you wish. You can also embed
special characters and tokens into the string that you set. These special
characters are linked with specific groups of tokens. These tokens will add
specific sets of information to your prompt.

Tokens for % are:
  %h  - current hitpoints                %m  - current mana (0 for vamp)
  %H  - maximum hitpoints                %M  - maximum mana (0 for vamp)
  %b  - current blood (0 for non-vamp)   %v  - current movement
  %B  - maximum blood (0 for non-vamp)   %V  - maximum movement
  %g  - gold held                        %x  - current experience
  %a  - your alignment                   %X  - experience needed to next level
  %A  - invisible/hide/sneak indicator   %S  - your current combat style
  %T  - Time of Day (RoD time)           %u  - total number of users
  %o  - object currently on auction      %w  - current weight
  %c  - current health of an opponent*   %W  - maximum weight
  %L  - command/attack waitstate
 
The other special characters are:
  &&  - Foreground color                  ^^  - Background color
 
Examples (assuming current hit points of 43, mana of 23, and movement of 120):
Prompt %h%m%v       =   4323120
Prompt <%h|%m|%v>>> =   <43|23|120>>>
Prompt %h %m %v     =   43 23 120
 
"Prompt fprompt" will set your prompt to display the same prompt information as
your current fprompt. "Fprompt none" will set your fprompt to display the same
prompt information as your current prompt.

*Deadlies will not be able to use the %c token to see opponent's health.

53 PULLTYPES~
Syntax: redit pulltype <exdir> <pulltype>
        redit pull <exdir> <force>
 
Pull forces can be used to move characters/objects from room to room using 
forces of nature. Pulltypes include the following : 
 
  undefined      vortex      vacuum      slip        ice         mysterious
  current        wave        whirlpool   geyser      wind        storm
  coldwind       breeze      landslide   sinkhole    quicksand   earthquake
  lava           fire        hotair.
 
Many of the pulltypes have an individualized message that may or may not apply
to the force you are looking to use. The amount of pull force ranges from -100
to 100. This effects the quickness at which the pull happens. A negative pull
force will PUSH the character in the opposite direction of the direction used.
This can also be accomplished by using a positive "push":
 
                      redit <dir> push <force>
 
The more extreme the number, the quicker the pull will happen. To see if a room
is affected with a pulltype, type "rstat ex".

1 QETAG REACH 'QETAG'S REACH'~
&GThe canyons of Qetag's Reach were uncovered and first populated by a
band of solitary Dwarf who were insistent upon staying neutral during
the conflict surrounding New Darkhaven. They lived peaceably, secure in
their solitude and completely self supportive, until the Great Betrayal.
 
Rumors abound on what happened that fateful night when the canyons were
overrun by Balrogs. One rumor holds more true than the rest; one of
their own gave up their location and brought them within the compound,
for the Balrogs swarmed from within, they did not storm the gates. If
that rumor holds true, it is questionable if the canyons are indeed
secure, even to this day.&w

physical world.

1 QUESTS QUESTING~
.
  Quests are run at random times for different groups of players within the
realms.  They may involve anything from a scavenger hunt, to solving riddles,
to killing mobs that threaten the Realms.  Quests are an excellent way to
meet other players, and enhance roleplaying throughout the realm.
  Different quests will result in different awards.  Awards are up to the
discretion of the immortal running the quest.
 
Some things to remember while questing:
 
 &W-&GWe are volunteers, and choose to run quests. If you have criticisms of 
    the quest, or the person running the quest, please be constructive and
    vent your concerns in an appropriate forum - in the Hall of Heroes located
    in the Darkhaven Town Hall.

 &W-&GQuest Council is here to increase your enjoyment of the game and to 
     enrich your experiences here. It is &YNOT&G here to explicitly increase 
your personal wealth.
 
 &W-&GDo not ask when the next quest will be, or if there is a quest. Just pay
    attention to channels and what is going on around you.  If something out
    of the ordinary is going on, there's a good chance it might be a quest.
 
 &W-&GUnless explicitly stated, Multi-playing is &YNOT&G allowed during quests.
    IF you are caught multi-playing, you will forfeit any reward, and most 
    likely have a temporary ban from questing placed on the characters involved

~

1 QUICKENING~
Syntax: c quickening
 
This spell increases the target's dexterity as it increases the adrenaline
flow throughout one's body.
~

1 QUIT~
Syntax: QUIT
 
QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere.  When you re-enter the game
you will be back in the same room, unless that room has a prog that moves
you upon re-entry.
 
QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just
one command.  Nevertheless, it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you
get into the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other
mud that doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.
 
There is no RENT here.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.

0 RANGER~
A ranger is the outdoorsman and adventuresome free spirit of the times.

A self-sufficient person, the ranger is adaptable and can survive in
almost any locale.  Skilled with weapons and able to utilize some of the
finest armor available, a ranger is physically skilled enough to take on
most any foe.  However, for especially hardy opponents, a ranger may also
avail himself of useful spells to both hinder his opponent and aid himself.

From minor curative magics to blinding his enemy, the ranger is the most
adept class at surviving on its own.  A ranger typically travels light, but
he does have the mighty strength of a warrior to carry equipment needed in
his travels.  Like the druid (the class other than warrior that he most
closely resembles), his need for help from outside sources is low.
 
The following races are acceptable to the ways of the Ranger:
Human Elf Dwarf Halfling Pixie Half-Elf

58 RAT~
Syntax: rat vnum1 vnum2 command [parameters]
 
Rat, or 'range at' is the at command with the added parameters of two
room vnums.  Assuming the vnums are valid, your 'at' command will be
executed in every room in the range you give.
 
Example: rat 100 110 redit flags 0
This will clear the room flags in all rooms from 100 to 110 inclusive.

Recommended Level Ranges : 25 - 50
 
North and east of Darkhaven lies the Mystic Seaport, where Captain Henry
sails to and from the lands of Duke Argyll Morgan aboard the sailing
vessel, the Sea Witch. Across the Sea of Tranquility, lies the quaint
fishing village of Glen Domaire. Further up the coast, is what is known as
the Wild Coast. Here you can find the Keep of Glen Morgan, ancestral home
of the Clan Dubh Glas, the fabled Westwood, and the Stonewall. The Stonewall
separates the Moors from Glen Morgan and slows the Scourge, which has ravaged
the Dukes' lands for generations. It is rumored that these marauders come from
the tower Dom Caligh atop the Raven Tor, the highest hill of the moorlands.

51 'RB EFF'~

                          &CElite Fighting Force
&B---------------------------------------------------------------------------
&C
The concept behind the EFF has been the same for years. Avatars of the Order
band together with one goal in mind. Death to any mob in their way. Teams are
formed through notes posted on the Council Board and times are chosen. Banks
of information are at the disposal of an EFF member and are quite helpful when
in doubt. The team hits a wide variety of mobs within the realms. Zyla, Zeus
Jade, Kahl, Father Time, Dracula, Mandor, Nelson, Various mobs within the
Knights of the Round, Danbala, Legba, the Froghemoth are not uncommon runs
within this organization.  Larger planned runs such as Darkness, Lord Seth,
Orcus and Sin/Olsen take place as well. Our order boasts the recent pop
of a Darkfire weapon.

The team members welcome new blood into the fold and quickly teach and adapt
to an individual's run style. Much can be learned and gained through membership
in this elite fighting force.

&wThe Order of Ringbearers is restricted to Avatar (level 50) characters. All
interested parties must be familiar with all Help Files pertaining to the 
Order of Ringbearers, as well as those pertaining to all Orders in general. 
Applicants to the Order of Ringbearers must have at least one sponsor within
the Order and one reference from another player in the Realms. Once an 
application has been received, the applicant will be contacted by a CK
(Council of Knowledge) member and a quest will be assigned to the applicant.
Once the quest has been completed to the CK members satisfaction, the
application will be passed on to the interview stage where the applicant 
will be asked about themselves and their interest in the Order of Ringbearers. 
If an applicant completes the interview and displays the attitudes and
qualities necessary to becoming a Ringbearer, then they will then proceed to
the voting process. The order as a whole will vote on their application. Any
application that receives two or more no votes will be denied. A leader will
then contact the applicant to tell them if they have passed or been denied.
All decisions are final and not subject to debate. Anyone who has been denied
membership may try applying again in three months time from the date of their
denial. New inductees are then put into an trial period for one month. They 
will be expected to have (Acolyte) in their title for this time. At the end
of one month the order will again vote on them. At this point it takes three
no votes to cause them to lose their status as a Ringbearer.

1 'RB' 'RINGBEARERS'~
&B---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        &CThe Order of Ringbearers
&B---------------------------------------------------------------------------
&CIn ancient times, savage creatures of all different classes, races, and
sexes fought as individuals, with little regard for others.  Soon, these
creatures of the world began to see the wisdom of forming groups for survival.
The first of these groups was the family.  Husband, wife, and children all
worked together to benefit the family.  This method of organization still
lacked sufficient power and opportunity.  After a number of centuries, the
first of the great guilds appeared, offering members a chance to unite based
on their chosen class. These guilds proved sufficient in providing for the
social needs of their members.  However, guild members were often forced to
look outside of their guild for needed resources...  In trying to fill this
void, several individuals began grouping together, and began what is now called
the Order of Ringbearers.
 
The primary goal of the Ringbearers' is to grasp the rings of truth, honor,
and knowledge.  This is done through exploring the Realms, teaching and
learning from others, and staying respectful to all others.
 
Equality in all forms is a central ideal of the Order of Ringbearers.  No
one class or race shall receive preference over another.  All segments
must unite in a circle, or a ring of brotherhood, to deliver success.
 
In the Order of Ringbearers, all members shall have the right to voice
their opinions and vote on Order policy.  No member shall be sanctioned
nor outcast for words they say while in the confines of the Order's
headquarter, or over Ordertalk, as long as they remain respectful and
honest to themselves and their fellow members.

~

0 RBEEP~
Syntax: rbeep <player>@<mudname>    - "beep" a player over IMC

Rbeep sends an audible beep to another player on another mud (the @mudname
part indicates which mud, see 'imclist'). Note that this should only be done
when you _really_ need to get their attention, abusing rbeep will usually
lead to your IMC privileges being revoked.
 
See also: IMC  IMCLIST
~

0 RCHANNELS RCHAN RINVIS~
Syntax:  rchannels                  - display your current IMC channel state
         rchannels +<channel>       - turn on an IMC channel
         rchannels -<channel>       - turn off an IMC channel

rchannels on its own will show you which IMC channels you have access to, and
whether they are currently on or off.

rchannels with an argument will turn on or off a given IMC channel that you
have access to.

rchannels can also be used to block rtells and rbeeps if necessary.

One additional option is rinvis. rchannels +rinvis will make you totally
invisible to IMC: you cannot be contacted by rtell, rreply, or rbeep, and
you do not appear on rwho. However, you cannot use any IMC channels while
rinvis is active (you can still hear them, though). rchannels -rinvis will
reverse this state.

Immortals may allow you access to IMC channels, or revoke your access to 
them, as necessary.

See also: IMC RCHAT RBEEP RTELL
~

51 RCHANSET~
Syntax:  chanset <player>             - see a players current IMC flags
         chanset <player> +<channel>  - set 'allow' flag on a player
         chanset <player> -<channel>  - set 'deny' flag on a player
         chanset <player> =<channel>  - reset allow/deny flags on a player

This command allows you to view or change a players IMC channel priviliges.
In all cases <channel> can be the name of an IMC channel (rchat, rcode, etc)
or 'rtell' or 'rbeep'.

Setting the allow flag for a channel allows that player to see and use that
channel, regardless of their level. This can be used, for example, to give
mortals with coding experience access to rcode.

Setting the deny flag for a channel prevents that player from using or
seeing that channel, even if their level normally allows them to. This can be
used as a penalty for players who abuse the IMC channels or rtell/rbeep.

Resetting the allow/deny flags simply clears them, using only the player's
level to determing whether they can use the channel.

51 RCONNECT~
Syntax:  rconnect <mudname>                - start an IMC connection

rconnect will initiate a connection to the given mud. Note that this has to
be a _directly_ connected mud (ie. a mud in the first section of imclist).
Feedback on the state of the connection will be logged to 'wiznet imc', and 
you may want to check imclist to see if it was successful.

See also: IMC 'IMC IMMORTAL' RDISCONNECT

51 RDISCONNECT~

1 'REALM OF WORSHIP'~
Recommended level range: 50 - 60

Very little is commonly known about the Realm of Worship, a series
of dark, lonely tunnels within the mountains of Moria. It was once the
residence of the Terror, the dreaded earthly manifestations of the Gods.
However, it is now empty save for the remaining guardians of Terror. Two
tales concerning this Realm's new purpose are being told lately. One claims
that the Realm now serves as a temple where the most desperate of followers
can come to convene with their God. The other dictates that the most powerful
Terror guardian has made a lair out of the dark tunnels. Whether these tales
are true or not, the Realm of Worship is wandered by only the most powerful
adventurers, and occasionally by those who seek a quick death.
~

1 REBOOT~
A reboot is a refresh of the system Realms of Despair runs on. It is usually
performed daily at 6:00 a.m. EST system time. It is automatically scheduled 
and any decision to re-schedule is at the sole discretion of the High 
Immortals.
 
A crash is an unplanned game reboot, caused by system errors. You can find
out when the system was last rebooted and when is the next scheduled reboot
with the time command.
 
When a scheduled reboot is soon to take place you will see a number of
warning messages beginning with:
 
        The seas across the realm have turned frigid. and
        You notice the life forms around you slowly dwindling away.
        Lightning crackles in the sky above! is the last message received 
        just before reboot.
 
A scheduled reboot automatically saves your character. A crash will not.
Saving frequently is always good practice.

58 REBOOT SHUTDOWN WIZLOCK~
Syntax: reboot <nosave>
Syntax: shutdown <nosave>
Syntax: wizlock

REBOOT shuts down the server.  When the normal 'startup' script is used
to control the server, a delay of sixty seconds will ensue (to allow
old connections to die), followed by a reboot.

SHUTDOWN shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it.

WIZLOCK is a toggle command.  When the server is WIZLOCKed, players
below level 51 may not log in.  Players who lose their links, however,
may reconnect.

If nosave is specified for reboot or shutdown, it will not automatically 
save all of the players.
~

1 RECALL~
With a scroll or potion of 'word of recall' you can instantly return from
most areas to your attuned recall spot (Thoth's Rune in Darkhaven for any
of those who are not deadly, clanned or a member of an Order or Guild).
 
Scrolls of recall are available in Darkhaven's section of magic shoppes.
 
See also: 'word of recall'
 
~

0 'RECHARGE'~
Syntax: cast 'recharge' <wand/staff>

This spell is used to recharge wands and staves after use.  The mage
or cleric performing the recharge should always ensure the item is
not fully charged, as overcharging is considered dangerous.  Also,
there is always a small chance of destroying the staff, or in even 
rarer instances multiplying the charges available.
~

0 REDFERNE 'REDFERNE RESIDENCE' 'REDFERNES RESIDENCE'~
Recommended level range: 35 - 47
 
After many aeons of seeming emptiness, the cloaking illusion of the fell
Sorceress Naris has been lifted from the building known unto men as Redferne's
Residence, or alternatively, The Stronghold of Naris. 
 
Redferne was a loyal knight paladin, true in both sword and honor.  Betrothed
in marriage to the lovely Naris of Thalos at a young age, they built a 
grand fortress and their lands prospered.  Naris, alas, dabbled in sorcery,
and as the years progressed, her soul was overtaken by the evils below.
 
When the fiend liches came to claim her body and soul, a mighty battle ensued,
in which Redferne himself is known to have lost his life.  Less is known of
Naris' fate.
 
The illusion of emptiness was in some manner related to the strange location
the fortress formerly held, floating in the firmament of Darkhaven.  When the
spell was broken, the fortress returned to its location of old, behind great
dark gates in a quiet corner of what is now refered to as the 'Old Marsh.'
~

53 REDIT~
Syntax: REDIT FIELD [parameter list]
        REDIT ON
 
FIELD  | PARAMETERS             -- DESCRIPTION / NOTES
---------------------------------------------------------------------
name   | <room name>            -- sets the room name / short description

exname | <direction> [keywords] -- sets an exit's keywords
exkey  | <direction> <key vnum> -- sets an exit's key vnum/value
 
Note: Put a '+' before the direction to force ADDing of that exit
      and use a '#' to specify the exit by sequential order.
 
REDIT ON will lock you into a mode in which 'redit' is implied in each command
sequence, and hitting enter will give you an instant rstat of whichever room
you are in at the time. To get out of REDIT ON, simply type the word DONE. 
Example:
 
        redit on
        name A dark and forboding hallway
        flags dark indoors
        done

1 'REIMB' 'REIMBURSEMENT'~
Deadly characters are never eligible for Reimbursements.
Experience can _not_ be reimbursed under any circumstances whatsoever.

The following are causes we will NOT reimburse for:
-- Loss of corpse due to corpse decay.  See "help corpse" for details.
-- Loss of corpse due to lag.
-- Loss of corpse due to problems with your system or the net.
-- Individual items lost due to not saving your character regularly.
-- Individual items lost due to carrying items above your level.
-- Individual items lost because they were zapped or dropped on the ground.
-- Containers lost because they were left on ground or destroyed by a mob.
-- Weapon loss due to disarm before crash, reboot, or from a mob taking it.
-- Items lost due to hitting a death trap
-- Items lost due to scrapping by mobs or other players
-- Items lost due transferring equipment from one character to another.
-- Items lost due to not saving after looting your corpse and a crash occurs.
 
Corpses are now saved across crashes and reboots, eliminating the need
for most reimbursements due to corpse loss.  The ONLY cause for reimbursement
is when a corpse reappears in the game empty after a crash or reboot.
If you are able to reequip or are not totally destitute (IE..nekkid), you will
not be considered for a reimbursement. 
To apply for a reimbursement post a note on the Oracle Board setting out the
circumstances of the loss and the five items you had prior to loss that you
would like reimbursed.  We will not reimburse certain items, such as gold,
potions, glory, clan items, or more than one weapon.  We will only consider
reimbursement requests made within one hour of a reboot or crash.  Only a
Demi God or higher may do a reimbursement, but any level Immortal may deny
one.  We will attempt to deal with the request as expeditiously as possible.
~

1 REKEY~
Rekey changes the keyword of an item.
It differs from rename in that it is not the name that is seen, but the
name the object is identified as and can be looked at or picked up as.
For example, if a sword of legend was rekeyed to blade , get sword would
no longer work with this item. (get blade would pick up the item)

   When an item is rekeyed, one of the words from the short description
     &GMUST&W be used in the rekey.
 
Rekey is included in the rename fee. See help glory for more information.
~

1 REMAINS~
&GSyntax:  remains&w
 
A worshipper may request knowledge on the disposition of their remains
from his or her deity (meaning the location and remaining time before
complete decay).  However, the imposition comes at the cost of a small
amount of favor -- approximately twice that of the character's level.
 
If no remains exist, there is no penalty to favor.
 
&GSee also:  &YFAVOR, SUPPLICATE, DEVOTE, DEITIES

&gA rename and/or rekey may be done by any level 54 or higher immortal.
Renames can be purchased with 20 glory or a rename scroll. Wedding renames
are done with a marriage license by Blorin in Darkhaven (See Help Wedding).
Renames are to be medieval in style for mortals and must not contain the
name of an immortal without their expressed consent. Items will not be
renamed to machine gun, silly putty, etc. Before contacting an immortal to
redeem glory or scrolls for a rename, please have in mind what you would
like done.  You will need to consider the following: 
 
&cShort description - &gwhat is seen when the item is worn by a person.
&cLong description  - &gwhat is seen when the item is lying on the ground.
&cRekey             - &grenaming of an item's keywords (See &w HELP REKEY&g)

1 'REOMYR VILLAGE' PIXIETOWN~
Tamorl recalls:
 
During the early times in the Realms, the pixie race led a peaceful existence
in Kontaur. They spent their days with pandas, otters, and members of the other
sylvan races. It wasn't long before the Balrogs and Carnifex laid siege to the
peaceful Realm of Kontaur.
 
The pixies and other sylvan races fled the onslaught to settle in the Pixie
Forest. Handing control to a quasit, they lived in peace for a time. Soon,
however, the destruction of this peaceful abode could be seen in the near
future. Sensing this, a brave young pixie named Reomyr gathered together other
wise and foresighted pixies. Together they constructed the Village of Reomyr.
 
The Village is said to be hidden somewhere within the Pixie Forest. Rumour has
it that Reomyr still resides in the Citadel in the city's center, keeping watch
over the race he helped save. It is said that he advises the new leaders of
their history and of the future, in hopes that the wisdom he grants will aid
the leaders in carrying on the race he has served for so many years.

1 REPAIR~
Syntax:   repair <object>
          repair all
 
Repair allows you to repair equipment and swords at metal blacksmiths,
and recharge staves and wands at magical 'blacksmiths.'  Repair all
attempts to repair every item in your inventory.
 
There is a 10% surcharge for using "repair all". This surcharge is for
the convenience of having all the equipment in your inventory repaired
at once.
 
~

54 REPAIRSET~
Syntax:  repairset <mobile vnum> <field> <value>
 
This command allows you to set the following fields for repair shops:

51 REPEAT~
Syntax: repeat <letter>
 
This command will repeat tell messages which you
have already received. If no parameters are given
it will simply produce the last tell you received.
If a single letter is given, then the last tell
sent to you by a character with a name starting
with that letter will be displayed. This is an imm
only command.
~

1 REPOP~
Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if there are no characters in
in the area; less often (15 minutes) if any characters are present.  Also
note that objects lying on the ground will not be regenerated if anyone
is in the area when it resets.
 
Area resets are indicated by messages such as 'you hear some squeaking noises'
just prior to reset.
~

54 'REPOP LEVELS'~
Item pops for shop keepers and area pops work like this:
 
First things you need to know :
    A. Area Soft Hi/Low
    B. Level of Mob
 
The terms used below mean:
    MIN - Area soft low
    MAX - Area soft high, or the MIN + 15, whichever is lower.
 
Items pop as follows:
Pills/Potions:        Random number between MIN and MAX
Scrolls:              Item's Value0 (Level of Spell)
Wands/Armor/Weapons:  Random number between MIN+4 and MAX+1
Staves:               Random number between MIN+9 and MAX+5
All others:           Currently 0
~

1 'REPORT' 'TIME' 'WEATHER'~

REPORT shows your current statistics to you and also announces them to other
players in the room.
 
TIME shows the game time, as well as the time the mud was last started,
and the current local time for the host computer.
 
WEATHER shows the current game weather.  You must be in an outside room
to see the weather.
~

59 RESERVE~
.
The "Reserve" command enables us to specify certain names that are
reserved and cannot be used by players.
 
We can specify names that we want to reserve because they belong to
former imms (like Narn and Dominus). We can specify names that are
often tried and are a bit of a pain (like Killer or Satan or Seth).
 
We can specify parts of names by preceding the string with an "*">
e.g.  reserve *goof
This will prevent any name with the substring "goof" ... like ...
"goofface", "biggoof" or "biggoofface".
All deity names should be reserved.
 
reserve                        list current reserved names
reserve joe                    add joe to the list if he's not on it
reserve joe                    remove joe to the list if he is on it
reserve *goof                  add the substring "goof" to the list

  The order that resets are in is VERY important.  You cannot equip
  a mobile with an object before putting the mobile into a room first.
  Likewise, you cannot put an object into a container until the container is
  put into a room first.

This command is used to display, edit, delete, add and insert resets for
your area.

Resilience renders the victim resistant to draining attacks.
~

0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~
Syntax:  rest
Syntax:  sleep
Syntax:  stand
Syntax:  wake
 
These commands change your position.
 
When you REST or SLEEP, you regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement
points at a much faster rate.  However, you are more vulnerable to attack,
and if you SLEEP you won't hear many things happen.
 
Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can also WAKE
other sleeping characters.

the combined power of two casters, chanting in unison.
~

54 RESTORE~
Syntax: restore <character>
        restore all

RESTORE restores full hit points, mana points, and movement points to the
target character.  RESTORE ALL does this for all mortals except player
killers and any who happen to be in the arena.
 
A note on RESTORE ALL: This is a gift from the gods, and it is never 
planned in advance or done on request.  The best way to ensure that a
restore all will NOT be done is to ask for one.
~

2 RESTORES~
&wWhen an immortal restores you, your full hit points, mana points,
and movement points are restored. Restore does this for all mortals 
except player killers and any who happen to be in the arena.

This is a gift from the gods, and it is never planned in advance or 
done on request. The best way to ensure that a restore all will NOT 
be done is to ask for one.
~

53 RESTORETIME~
Restoretime shows you how much time has passed since you last did a
restore all. All Immortals between the levels of 53 and 58 can do one
restore all per 6 hours of Real Time. No one is quite certain of what
level can do a restore all at any time, but we'll find out one day.
~

57 RESTRICT~
restrict<command>      -Displays the current level of the command.
restrict <command>          -Displays the current level of the command
 
Please remember to set the command back to its original level when you
are done with it. Some commands may not be restricted.
~

1 RETELL~
Syntax: retell <message>
 
This command will send a message to the last character you sent a tell
to. It will override the reply command by sending your tell to your last
victim. Any other tells received before retelling will not be targetted.
 
&GExample:     &YTELL joe hello
             &WYou tell Joe 'hello'
             &WJill tells you 'hi'
             &YRETELL hello again
             &WYou tell Joe 'hello again'
 
&GAs you can see, Jill's tell was ignored and the RETELL went directly to Joe.
&W

This command will set or remove the 'retired' flag on the immortal
you use it on.

1 'REVELATION CITY'~
Recommended level range: 35 - 50

The City of Revelations lies on the shores of the Sea of Sorrows, shrouded
by a veil of mist. It is said to be a city of Lost Gods, similar to Olympus
and Hades. Some sages believe it is simply inhabitated by powerful entities
and thought elementals. Most adventurers will notice how they go unnoticed
when exploring the town, leading to the belief that only some of these 
entities are aware of what is happening on this plane. Below the city is a
flaming Lake of Fire. In the heart of this sea of flame is a fiery isle,
where one can enter the Underworld.

0 RIGNORE~
Syntax:  rignore                           - list current rignores
         rignore ignore  <pattern>         - ignore player(s) or mud(s)
         rignore notrust <pattern>         - don't trust player(s) or mud(s)
	 rignore delete  <pattern>         - remove a rignore

rignore ignores or restricts the access, at a mud-wide level, everything
coming in over IMC for a specified player or group of players. Currently
two possible actions are possible: ignore and notrust.

Ignore means:

- rtells/rbeeps/rwhos will be ignored, and a rtell sent back to say that the
  mud is ignoring them.
- no messages from them on rchat, rcode, etc will appear on your mud.

Notrust means:

- any rwho/rfinger/etc requests from a mud/player matching the pattern will
  be treated as if they were from a level 1 mortal - ie. wizi imms will never
  be revealed on rwho, and rtells won't see them, etc.
- any incoming channel messages from something matching the pattern are
  stripped of wizi status - they will be visible to everyone in general.

Patterns can be one of:

  player@mud              - matches a specific player at a specific mud
  *suffix                 - matches anything ending with that suffix
                            (commonly used as *@mud)
  prefix*                 - matches anything beginning with that prefix
                            (for example, player@*)
  *substring*             - matches anything containing that substring

Use with care.

54 ROD_HIST_TEST~
The Age of Creation:
In the beginning there was a formless void.  Chaos reigned supreme and all
efforts to bring order were of no value.  Then the mind of Thoric crossed
the Great barrier and began to draw the strands of life, magick, power and
consciousness to the formlessness of the void.  Hard he laboured and
mightily he strove to attempt to bring order from the chaos.  To assist
him he imbued others with some of his power and titled them Immortals.  
After a time the Realms were constructed and imbued with life and power.
Mortals walked the surface of the land, swam in it's waters or flew through
it's skies.  They battled the creatures there for supremacy and to exert
their will over all other things.  Thoric was pleased but realized that
there would be a continual struggle to maintain the Order against the
natural trepidations of Chaos.  He relegated much of his power to the
Immortals; to care for and maintain his creation while he battled Chaos
in other arenas.  The Immortals took on his task and continued to fight
Chaos in their own varied ways.
 
The Age of Deities:
And it came to pass that the Immortals, in their continual struggle to
maintain the trust that Thoric had passed down to them, required assistance
in answering the prayers of the mortals of the Realms.  The power of prayer
fostered the growth of the Deities: beings of similar powers to the Immortals
but dedicated to answering the pleas of mortals.

1 ROLEPLAY ROLE-PLAY ROLE-PLAYING~
Role-playing - the art of creating and acting out a character
complete with distinct mannerisms, speechpatterns and personality
when interacting with other players on the game. While
in character (IC), a player would act and react as his
defined character would.  While out of character (OOC), a
player would act as he or she would in "real life".  A good
role-player takes into consideration all aspects of the
era in which his character lives. ie: living habits, mannerisms
of the times and the history of the times.  A good
role-player not only acts in character but reacts in character
to the ongoing's around him.
 
A good role-player never takes anything personal when playing
out their character or hides behind their character to act out
real life grievances.

51 RQUERY~
Syntax:  rquery <mudname> help         - ask for available rquery options
         rquery <mudname> <option>     - ask for information from a mud

RQuery is similar to rwho, except it requests different information from a
mud. Each mud differs in what information it supplies, but 'rquery <mudname>
help' will give you a list of options that you can ask for.

Typically at least the following are supported:

rquery <mud> who        - ask for a who listing, identical to 'rwho'
rquery <mud> info       - get general information on the mud, usually including
                          its address. This is the preferred way of finding
                          out the address of a mud on IMC - don't ask on rchat!
rquery <mud> list       - ask for a list of IMC connections, from that mud's
                          point of view. Identical to 'imclist' on the remote
                          mud.
rquery <mud> istats     - ask for some IMC statistics, identical to 'istats' on
                          the remote mud.

51 RREPLY~
Syntax: rreply <message>
Rreply will send <message> to the last player to send you an rtell.
~

0 RSOCKETS~
Syntax:  rsockets                   - display IMC socket usage

rsockets displays the current connection state for the direct IMC connections
that your mud has. The various fields are:

Desc  : the system-level descriptor used for this connection

Mud   : which mud this connection is for

State : how far through the connection process this connection is:
        - connecting: waiting for the other end to accept our TCP connection
        - wait1:      waiting for the password from an incoming client
        - wait2:      waiting for the server to respond to our password
        - connected:  the connection is completely 'up'

Inbuf : the size of data waiting in the input and output queues for this
Outbuf: connection.

0 RTELL RREPLY~
Syntax:  rtell <player@mudname> <message>    - send a 'tell' to another player
         rreply <message>                    - send a 'tell' to the last player
                                               to send you a rtell

rtell and rreply are the IMC equivalents of tell and reply, and work nearly
identically. To rtell, however, you need to supply both a playername and a
mudname (as shown in 'imclist'). rreply will reply to the last rtell you
received from a player - even if that player was invisible to you.

-1 RUDE~
Etiquette is an important function of day to day survival both on the
Realms and in real life (irl).  Many people do not realize it but even
little things can be considered "rude" and create the impression that you
are not a person worthy of polite society.  In an effort to assist new and
old players we have provided a list of activities which might be considered
to fall within the rubric of "RUDE".
 
1.  Use of Capitals -- a message, especially on public channels, that is 
comprised of all capital letters is annoying.  It is a akin to shouting and
creates a significant glare on all monitors.  We would kindly ask you to 
refrain from their usage.

2.  Repeating a message --  continually requesting or repeating the same
message is considered rude.  Offering something in trade repeatedly or 
asking for an uplift over and over again is not the proper solution.  Most
people can see the message the first time and if they want the item or wish
to help they will.  Repeatedly sending out the same message will only annoy
others and is a sure way _not_ to get your message across.  See help spam.
 
3.  Making fun of new players --  everyone has a different learning curve
on the Realms.  That does not mean that they do not derive the same enjoyment
from the game as yourself.  It is rude to make fun of people who are just
learning to play on this MUD and are asking for assistance.  Please recall
the errors you may have made when you started out.
 
4.  Swearing -- the English--or any other--language is a wonderful device
for communicating one's feelings.  Vulgar or obscene language is not 
necessary to get your point across.  Additionally, it is a violation of the
rules of this game.  Please refrain from swearing on public channels.  Kick
your desk or dog instead.

5.  Following -- Following a character without their permission is not
considered "polite."  If you want to find an area for levelling use the ask
or chat channels.

6.  Killsteals -- It is illegal and should not be done.  If a character is
fighting a mob do _not_ join in without the character's permission.  See
help killsteal.
 
7.  Charmies -- It is considered "rude" to charm all the mobs in a given area
and monopolize them for your own purposes.  You should give other people a
chance to kill mobs.  This is doubly important when the mob has sought after
equipment.  By the same token, gratuitously slaughtering all charmed mobs one
runs across is also considered "rude."  Take a second and inquire if the mob 
one is killing is a pet or needed for something.  A fine balance is always
required when dealing with charmed mobs.  Most arguments can be settled in
advance if the parties remember to communicate with each other.  It doesn't
take much time and will assist in avoiding needless fights and recriminations.

1 'RUINS OF TMAN'~
&wSecure in the darkest recesses of the Miden'nir, deep in the heart 
of the Black Forest, among the Ruins of T'man lies the fortress of 
the Half-Troll Nation.  Those not of Trollish kin, should fear to 
venture into these ruins.  For should you survive the merciless
onslaught of the guards, death surely awaits you upon reaching the
murky waters of the moat which surrounds the keep.

1 RUINS UMBRAGEOUS~
Enforced level range: 1 - 50 (pkill only)

After the last Clan Wars, the gods looked down upon the ruins of old
Darkhaven and shifted them into another plane, one that can only be
reached by those who follow a dark and shadowy path. Now decayed beyond
recognition, the shambled remnants of once great structures cover all
signs that this was once the prosperous center of Despair. Burning lava
flows through the city and moving shadows hide killers in their shroud
of darkness. It is said that those who venture through the ruins, and
lived to tell about it, that there are secret portals and passages hidden
within that will lead to the main plane of Despair. It is also rumored
that the spirit of Gravoc oversees the ruins, enforcing his own brand
of death and destruction.
 
No peacefuls are permitted in the Ruins at any time.

1 'SANCTUM OF THE ARCANES'~
The Great Sundering of the Clans was a time of chaos and disillusionment
for the inhabitants of the Realms. Many of the homes of the great Clans
were left in ruins; never to be revisited by their heroes again. However,
from those ruins arose the Guardian Brothers Marduk and Marruka, who salvaged
the magicks of the Arcanes and stole away to a secret location far from prying
eyes. There, surrounded by a giant forest made larger than life by the powerful
magicks of the Guardians, the Brothers rebuilt the Castle. Legend holds that 
the bricks and mortar of the Castle, known today as the Sanctum of Arcanes,
were imbued with the strong magicks of the Guardians as a protection for the
Order against attack or ruin.

1 SAVE~
Syntax:  Save
 
SAVE saves your character and its inventory; you must be at least second
level to save.  The system automatically saves approximately one character
every minute, but with the high number of players usually online it may take
hours before your own is auto-saved.  For this reason, you should not
rely on auto-save to keep your character updated -- save frequently.
 
Type SAVE immediately after recovering your corpse, gaining experience or
a level in battle, getting new items, making purchases or repairs, etc.
 
Some objects (such as keys) may not be saved.  You cannot SAVE and QUIT
with objects of a higher level than your own, as they will vanish when
you log out.  Every character is auto-saved at reboot.

52 SAVEAREA LOADAREA~

54 SAVINGTHROWS~
Saving throws:
  sav1 - Saving vs. poison or death
  sav2 - Saving vs. wands
  sav3 - Saving vs. paralysis or petrification
  sav4 - Saving vs. breath
  sav5 - Saving vs. spells or staves

See MSET or type MSET by itself.
 
SEE ALSO:   'savingthrows explained'
~

51 'SAVINGTHROWS EXPLAINED'~
Sav Vs _________  Calculations
 
To determine the amount of Sav_vs you want to give a mob, apply the following
formula:
 
50 + ( Mob_level - target ch level - Sav_Vs )*5 = Percentage of time to save
 
Solve for Sav_Vs.
 
 
For example, I want my mob to get hit by breath 25% of the time. (or save vs
breath 75% of the time) The mobs target level character is avatar, and the mobs
level will be 54.
 
50 + ( 54 - 50 - Sav_vs ) * 5 = 75
 
or   (54 - 50 - Sav_Vs)*5 =  25
 
or   (54 - 50 - Sav_Vs)   = 25/5  or 5
 
or   ( 4 - Sav_Vs ) = -1
 
or   Sav_Vs = -1
 
 
So, in this case, to lower the chance of saving vs breath of a level 54 mob
against an avatar's breath spell, you would set the mobs sav4 to -1.
~

1 SCORN~
They are the "Un" of society.  The unwanted, unacknowledged, unthanked, 
unpopular, uneasy, unhappy, uncomfortable, unkind, unfortunate, unconforming,
unconvinced, unavowed, unnamed, unused, unaccustomed, unloved, unlamented, 
undeplored, unendeared, and unvalued.
 
Uncorrupted, however, is not amongst the clan's assorted descriptions.  Backed
by a mysterious Demonic Lord, the once neglected are shown favoritism.  Fueled 
by his power, they have retained their status of "Un", though of  far different
types.  They are unnatural, unusual, undescribable, unquenchable, unmerciful, 
unsavory, and perhaps most of all, unforgiving and unrelenting.
~

1 'SCOURGE OF TIME'~
Since the origins of life, the mysteries of time-travel have managed to
swiftly elude any and all mortal attempts to decipher them.  Following
the brutal massacre of the village of Brokovia by the Githyanki, a spirited,
desperate survivor sought revenge. She devoted herself to the practice of
Infernalism in an attempt to reveal the mysteries of time. She thought that
if she was able to travel back in time, she might be able to save her
ravaged home. As her studies progressed, however, she became unable to
control her own thoughts and actions. She came to realize how to travel
back in time, though her evil mannerisms had already gained the attention
of the Old Man himself. Because of her demonic prowess, the ancient lord
banished her, forever, from time-travel. Not able to finish her quest, the
demoness now roams the Astral Plane, sending would-be heroes to combat
her nemesis. In fear of her threats, the father generated a massive defense
to protect the sanctity of his domain. This proved successful against the
likes of the demoness...
 
However, the Old Man cannot guard against those things that previously
passed through and began to evolve into threats much more evil...
~

0 SCRIBE BREW~
&YSyntax&W: brew <spell name>
&YSyntax&W: scribe <spell name>

A mage or cleric of sufficient level holding a 'blank scroll' or
'empty flask' may transform them into spelled scrolls or potions via
the scribe and brew commands.

It takes significantly more mana to bind a spell to a potion or scroll
than to simply cast it.

1 'SEA OF SORROWS'~
Recommended Level Range: 1 - 15
 
The Sea of Sorrows is a large body of water far to the east of Darkhaven,
bordering much of the Realms. It is said that the sea was created long ago
from the tears of the New Goddess, Brittany. Her kind heart was moved when the
Old Gods were cast aside in favor of Brontrel's new order. Famed Uthle bay
in the eastern portion of the sea is the sole entrance to Transylvania,
land of vampires.

-1 SEAELF SEA-ELF SEA-ELVES SEAELVES 'SEA ELF'~
Also called Aquatic Elves, they are akin to mermen as land elves are
akin to men.  Found almost exclusively among heavy weed beds in quiet,
sheltered, salty waters, they are great friends of the dolphins.  The
race historically prefers to fashion caverns in lagoon bottoms and
reefs in which to live and work, but the reality of the today's Realms
has forced them into the general populace.

The race is humanoid in appearance, with gill slits on the throat and
greenish-silver skin and green or blue-green hair.  Sea elves have an
&Ginnate ability to find magical auras&w as well as the &Ginherent
capacity to breathe underwater&w and a &Gresistance to cold&w.

These are powerful skills which allow a character to attack more than
once per combat round.  Use of these skills is automatic once you have
practiced them.
 
While you can practice the attacks out of turn (third attack before you
have mastered second attack, for example), it is extremely inefficient
to do so.

1 SENTINEL  'THE SENTINEL'~
&WRecommended level range: 5 - 15
 
&GThe vast northern plains of the Realms harbor many settlements, including
the small, isolated village of Kusnir. Plagued by constant troubles, this
fishing village on the shores of Lake Spendlowe is desperate for someone
to seek out the source of the evil that besieges their simple hamlet. It
is rumored that a powerful magical artifact of ancient origin yet exists
somewhere in the dangerous lands surrounding Kusnir- but who knows?
~

57 SETBOOT~
Syntax: setboot time <hour> <minute>
 	setboot manual <0|1>

The setboot command is useful for planning a reboot, (to save you from 
the trouble of all those echos :) ) and for the daily boot.  The manual
bit is used by the mud to determine whether the boot time was set by 
hand.  When the mud starts up, the boot time is set to 0600hrs (6am)
and the manual bit to 0.  If 'setboot time' is used, the mud sets the
manual bit to 1.  When it comes time to do the reboot, the mud checks
how long it has been running.  If it has been running less than 18 
hours and the reboot time has not been set manually, the reboot does
not take place (nor do the automatic warning echoes).

Echoes: when a scheduled reboot is coming up, the mud will send out
echoes to that effect.  The echoes start 30 minutes before the reboot
and are repeated at t minus 15, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 minute(s). 
~

55 SETCLAN~
Usage: setclan <clan> <field> <deity|leader|number1|number2> <player>
 
With &YSetclan&W a deity or high level immortal can make changes to the
parameters for a particular clan. These include the storage vnum, recall,
main board, leaders, motto, desc, and type.
 
These also include the Leadrank, Onerank and Tworank commands, which are
set to the clan file, rather than the individual leader. This prevents
immortals from having to make changes to ranks everytime a leader position
is retired by one player and given to another.
 
&YPolicy on clanset Leader Ranks&W:
The rank of any organization leader, and the alteration of said rank
upon the ascension of a new leader, is the perogative of an organization's
deity. The leader rank may contain both a rank and prefix.
 
The rank of an organization's number one and number two are set
permanently and do not change.  The inclusion of the usage of
number one and number two ranks is the perogative of the deity.
 
Ranks are the responsibility of the organization deity.  Any requests to
add or alter ranks must be handled through the organization's deity

1 SETH 'SETH FORTRESS' 'SETHS FORTRESS'~
Recommended level range: 20 - 50

The dark fortress of Dread Lord Seth lies in the southeast region of
Despair, and is a constant thorn in A'enaar's side.  It is rumored that the
Dread Lord is a dark child created from the stolen essence of the Lord
of Darkness by Vl'arescht, and given life through the power of Laschte.
Within the halls of his fortress wander unholy experiments in darkness,
watched over by his dread priesthood. Further within is Laschte's gift to
Seth, the Chaos Maze. A swirling maze of corporeal chaos where direction
and logic have no meaning. Beyond lies the heart of the fortress where the
Dread Lord has gathered the vilest, most evil creatures to ever walk Despair.
The few who penetrate this far into the Fortress always return with silenced
tongues and despair in their hearts, if they return at all...

lich, he created the hideous shadowmists and formed Shadowport from rock with
incredible magics. Many an adventurer has fought his final battle here, and

The shattered remains of the ancient civilization of tinker gnomes resides
here, to the southeast of eastern Darkhaven and in the shadow of a fiercesome
mountain range. Inhabitating the tunnels beneath the mountains are the
gnome's perpetual enemies, and one time students: the hobgoblins. Similar to
goblins in many ways, they lack the intelligence and inventiveness of the 
gnomes. This is made up however in good measure with cunning and wicked ways.
This filthy chaotic race has made it their goal to rule the gnomes, and 
eventually all of Despair itself.

1 SMAUG~
&GThe Smaug code base has an associated and very active mailing
list which contains answers to many questions both large and
small, and also contains information about the Smaug FAQ.  To
subscribe to the mailing list:

 - send mail to smaug-request@realms.game.org with the word
   "subscribe" in the subject of the text

NOTE:&W  Most immortals of the Realms are not involved in the
Smaug code project and probably cannot answer your questions
unless they are listed in the Smaug credits. Please seek your
answers from the appropriate immortals or from sources located
on the mailing list.&G 
 
For information on installing Smaug, see help &Wsmaug1&G, &Wsmaug2&G,
and &Wsmaugstart&G.  Also see help &Wbuilding&G.

1 SMAUG1~
&GTo get SMAUG running under Windows 95, perform the following
steps, in order:

1.  Download the following files from ftp.game.org/pub/smaug
    to C:\
       SMAUG1.02.TGZ
       SMAUGw32.ZIP OR SMAUGW32_1_02A.ZIP
       Note: The two zip files are mutually exclusive. One
       file has routines for CRYPTO.  See the index on the
       ftp site for details.  Download only the latest
       version of the programs.

2.  Download an UNTGZ program and a copy of mIRC or identd from a
    web site that has them. IF your uncompression program is able
    to handle both zip and tgz files, this step may be unnecessary.

3.  With SMAUG1.02.TGZ in your C:\ root directory, UNTGZ the file.
    This will build the directories needed for SMAUG.

See help &Wsmaug2&G for Windows information.
~

1 SMAUG2~
&G4.  Copy or move the smaug zip file into C:\DIST\SYSTEM and unzip
    the file.

5.  Copy C:\DIST\SYSTEM\cygwin.dll to C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM

6.  Copy the .ARE and .LST files into C:\DIST\SYSTEM

7.  Run mIRC/identd software and minimize the window.  This handles
    the addressing routines.  If it is not active, you may experience
    a lot of lag as the system attempts to resolve the addressing
    for the screen displays and responses.
 
8.  Open a DOS window and set your memory configuration to place as
    much of your memory into EXTENDED memory allocation as possible.
 
9.  To run SMAUG, you can either:
    a)  Open a DOS window, go to C:\DIST\SYSTEM and type SMAUG.
    b)  In windows, go to C:\DIST and double click on the SMAUG.EXE
        file.

10.  Using a client, sign on to your new MUD using 127.0.0.1 port 4000.

See help &Wsmaugstart&G to learn how to create your initial immortal.

1 SMAUGSTART~
&GIf you downloaded a version of Smaug with name authorization
enabled by default, the following steps will explain how to
create your initial immortal and disable authorization if you
so choose:

  &WUsing pico, joe, vi or some other text editor, load sysdata.dat
  and change "Waitforauth    1" to "Waitforauth    0".  This will
  disable the name authorization system, and new characters will
  appear in the academy and be advanced from level 1 to level 2.
 
  Once you've made such a character and it is advanced to level 2,
  go in to the corresponding player directory, load the pfile, and
  edit its level to 65.  You're now ready to log your level 65 in
  to your mud and proceed.&G

For information on installing Smaug, see help &Wsmaug1&G, &Wsmaug2&G.
Also see help &WSmaug&G and &Wbuilding&G.

1 'SOLAR FLIGHT'~
Syntax:  c 'solar flight' <victim>
 
This spell allows the caster to merge from an outdoor area to their victim
in an outdoor area.
 
The spell has a few restrictions:  you will only succeed in casting it
during daytime hours, between 7 A.M. and 5 P.M. and you will only succeed
in casting if both you and your victim are in an outdoor area -- you need
the power of the sun in order for this spell to work (thus it will also
not succeed in bad weather).
~

1 'SOLOMONIC INVOCATION'~
Syntax:  c 'solomonic invocation'
 
The Paladin prayer by which their holy symbol is created.
 
~

1 'SONIC RESONANCE'~
The magick of 'Sonic Resonance' allows the casting Mage to realign
the component particles of his foe in such a way that they are
susceptible to a certain mystical tone.  By the completion of the
spell, this tone is conjured, causing the particles to vibrate 
violently causing intense pain and tissue damage.
~

1 SPAM~
No, we are not talking about a luncheon meat here.  Spam is the repeated use
of a phrase, command, or channel that causes screen scroll for others.  Not
only is spam considered rude, but excessive screen scroll can interfere with
the game play of anyone seeing it (not to mention combat situations).  The
game will also tell you to PUT A LID ON IT and force-quit you after the 20th
repeat of a single command
 
It is also considered spam to use the same phrase over several different
channels.  The use of all-caps can also be considered spam.  Only use
capitals to add emphasis to key words in a sentence.
 
Moving a large number of items into and out of a container in a crowded, 
non-store room is considered spam.  Using multiple characters to chat the
same message at the same time is considered spam.  Making charmed mobs
or pets to cause screen scroll through movement or orders is considered
spam. ANYTHING that causes excessive or irritating screen scroll can be
considered spam.
~

51 SPEAK LANGUAGE~
&WSyntax: speak <language>
Syntax:  speak all (immortals only)
 
&GTo speak a specific language, such as common, type: speak common
 
Immortals have the unique ability to speak so that everyone can understand,
by typing "speak all".
 
&YSee also: &Whelp languages&w

54 SPECFUNCS~
These special functions are available to assign to mobiles.
Use them sparingly:

To add spec:  mset <mob> spec <function> (ex. mset guard spec spec_guard)
To remove:    mset <mob> spec none

spec_breath_any          Mobiles breathes one of the four breaths randomly.
spec_breath_acid         Mobile has breath of acid.
spec_breath_fire         Mobile has breath of fire.
spec_breath_frost        Mobile has breath of frost
spec_breath_gas          Mobile has gas breath.

spec_executioner         Same as above except summons guards to help.
spec_fido                Mobile eats corpses.
spec_janitor             Mobile picks up trash.
spec_mayor               Reserved for the mayor... don't use.
spec_poison              Mobile poisons during battle.
spec_thief               Mobile steals gold from players.

62 SPECTRAL FUROR~
After the Dark Mage Thanatos accidentally discovered the spell
'Disruption' in a failed attempt to create a teleportation magic,
he spent many years studying how to increase the pain that can
be inflicted by incorrectly moving a victim across the threshold
of dimensions.  
 
 'Spectral Furor' is a formula which, by upsetting the very nature
of the space the victim inhabits causes neural as well as brute
physical damage.
 
With 'Hand of Chaos,' Thanatos perfected this line of magic, and he
returned to his researches on the art of astral travel.

1 'SPECTRAL GATE'~
Recommended level range: 1-2

It is a well known fact that when a God creates a mortal, the being
enters the multiverse through the Spectral Gate. The strange journey
through this portal sobers the mortal and determines his demeanor
and nature. All know as well that once you enter the multiverse, you
may never return through the Spectral Gate.

56 SPELLCOMPONENTS~
T###         check for item of type ###
V#####       check for item of vnum #####
Kword        check for item with keyword 'word'
G#####       check if player has ##### amount of gold
H####        check if player has #### amount of hitpoints
 
Special operators:
+ don't consume this component
@ decrease component's value[0], and extract if it reaches 0
# decrease component's value[1], and extract if it reaches 0
$ decrease component's value[2], and extract if it reaches 0
% decrease component's value[3], and extract if it reaches 0
decrease component's value[4], and extract if it reaches 0
decrease component's value[5], and extract if it reaches 0
and ! will make the spell fail if the caster is carrying that component.
 
Example: V1100 V+1101
The spell will only succeed if the caster is carrying objects of vnums
1100 and 1101.  The object of vnum 1100 will get consumed by the spell,
and the object of vnum 1101 will not.
 
With the decremental operators (@#$%), the object must have at least
a value of 1 in the respective location for the spell to succeed.

1 STORY~
. At the Dawn of Time, Thoric weaved the multiverse and elevated a thousand
mortals to godhood through divine ascension. The Supreme Entity then receded
from the vision of all mortals and minor Gods, for these held little sway over
his creation. The multiverse slowly began to take shape, order being formed
from swirling chaos by the Thousand. Hundreds of planes and demiplanes were
created, each one looked over by a pantheon of all-mighty deities. It was the
Age of Peace. There was no enmity between the Gods of Good and Evil, for
both sides understood the importance of Balance. For thirty thousand years,
the multiverse knew bliss - then Dominus, Lord of Darkness, struck.
  Dominus was one of the Hundred whom Thoric held in favor and convened with
regularily. The God of Darkness detested the need to bicker and discuss his
plans with others and thus plotted to eliminate the other Gods so that he may
rule supreme. He weaved a plane he named Es'tilith. He then spent a thousand
years convincing Thoric that a prison plane for traitorous Gods was needed, a
place where those who broke the Codex of Thoric could be kept for eternity.
Thoric finally complied and enchanted the prison plane with the magics
necessary.
  The Lord of Darkness then summoned the Thousand in a display of magic
that will never be matched. Dominus presented his Void of Retention, quickly
easing the fears of the Gods and encouraging them to explore the plane. The
Thousand were intrigued and entered Es'tilith, thus becoming trapped for
eternity. Then the Age of Plea began.
  For thirty thousand years, the trapped Gods pleaded to Thoric for freedom,
while Dominus weaved his lies across the mortal planes, watching peace turn
to war, order to chaos. Thoric eventually acknowledged their cries and declared
that Dominus' treachery was fate and the Thousand would remain forever trapped
in Es'Tilith. The Supreme Entity, the True Creator, then gave Dominus leave to
destroy and remake the multiverse in his own vision.
See Help Story2...
~

1 STORY2~
. And so the multiverse was destroyed. Comforting Oblivion now reigned
over all. This peace did not last long however, as a powerful backlash
arose from Dominus' magic wielding, a strange entity containing the very
essence of magic. It quickly weaved a new plane and world. A monument to
life was grown, which it called the Tree of Life. From the Tree sprung
creatures of all types, just as they were before Dominus wielded Oblivion
against them. New lands were created and these slowly spread outward from
the Tree. Cities were founded and conquered, and life began anew. The Tree 
also blessed some beings with knowledge of the Old Ways. These few mortals
learned about the Lost Gods and took to worshipping them.
  Dominus eventually discovered this seed of Life within the vast void and,
with a mere thought, destroyed it. As he was about to eradicate the remains of
the unnamed plane, Thoric halted his hand, deeming that none would interfere
with this interesting offspring of magic. Dominus was given the eternal task of
overseeing this plane, which Thoric named Despair.
  Despair began as a world of Goodness, yet has now been corrupted over the
ages by Dominus and the Gods he raised through divine ascension. The peaceful
mortals of this now dark plane find themselves pressed into war against the
Darkness. Beings of Light have become increasingly rare and a single, great
resistance has bound together: the towns of Solace, Ofcol, New Thalos, 
Ocean Keep and most importantly, Darkhaven. All the other Realms of Despair
have fallen, and thus does Good's hope falter and wither...
~

1 STR STRENGTH~
Strength (STR in your 'score') represents your character's physical power.
 
The most common concern with strength deals with how much your character
can carry.  For each additional point of strength  you gain an additional
amount of maximum carryable weight.  Any character with 20 strength can
carry 500kgs; Warriors, Rangers and Paladins can have a maximum of
25 strength, and can therefore carry up to 999kgs when their strength
is at its maximum.

Strength also affects (among other things):
 
 - damage roll and hitroll; for each additional point of strength, each
   of these will increase
 
 - chances of success for bash, stun, bashdoor, shove and drag, and the
   ability to dual-wield heavier weapons
 
Strength is the prime attribute of warriors, rangers and paladins.

1 STYLE STYLES~
Usage: style <style name>

experienced one is in a particular style, the better the chances that it
will work for the fighter's advantage. There are five different known
styles. Styles can be changed within combat to better ones advantage
and knowledge of each of the different forms of combat.

1 'SULFUROUS SPRAY'~
With the incantation 'Sulfurous Spray,' the casting mage culls from
the air the elements necessary to form a strong acid which rains
down upon his opponent or opponents.  This strength and velocity
of the spray is such that it can work its way into various forms
of armor and clothing, and it is also able to harm opponents one
might think resistant to such attacks, due to its magical nature.

~

1 SURREPTUS~
No one is entirely sure how the Surreptus came about.  Common speculation and
rumor holds that overwhelming greed and the pursuant nature of Justice drove a 
band of thieves belowground, where they lived for decades, biding their time
until they were forgotten.  As the years passed, fraternization caused their
numbers to swell, their children developing to withstand the treacherous 
underground domains.  Little order existed in the society, and power was held
by those who controlled what few material goods the group possessed, which led
to incredibly violent skirmishes in attempts to gain them.  Over time, after
the original generation had passed on, their history was forgotten.  Immolative
magics used during the "Age of Vampires" eventually wore through the overland,
revealing some of the tunnels to the surface.  As the magics continued to tear
through vampire after vampire, a few Nosferatu stumbled onto the tunnels, and 
entered them, before sealing them off, thinking perhaps they were some 
forgotten entrance to their own familiar warrens.  These last of the Vampires 
finally found the then-childish race of underdwellers, jokingly calling them
"Surreptus", noting their near-worship of  the wealthy items and thieving
practices.  The Surreptus accepted the Nosferatu into their society as 
wise-men, learning of all the practices of the surface world, gasping in awe as
they heard of the treasures to be found.  After the rumbling of the warring 
above ceased as the remaining vampires on the surfaces eliminated each other,
below the surface, the Nosferatu taught the Surreptus to fight together towards
a common goal, the value of fighting in packs, and usage of lightning fury on 
the unexpected, striking the unwary and unprepared before they become aware
of what's going on.  With their training complete, the Surreptus venture 
upwards towards the surface world that is now so foreign to them.

53 THAC0~
In the old days of table top roleplaying, when you wanted to attack a creature 
you would have to roll a die.  That die had 20 sides to it, 1 through 20 - 
your "hit die". (A die roll of 1 is called a "critical miss", while a die roll 
of 20 is called a "critical hit". Critical misses or hits simply mean you are 
guaranteed to miss/hit regardless of your stats.) Your character also had a 
stat called "thac0" (to-hit-armor-class 0).  This stat meant that in order to 
hit a creature with an armor class of 0, you had to roll that number or better.
A decent thac0 would have been a 12 maybe. Which would mean if you rolled a 12 
or better, you'd hit a creature with an armor class of 0. 
 
What if the creature had an armorclass of -1? Add one to your thac0. So now
you need a thirteen or better to hit the creature.  And the reverse being true.
An armor class of 5, would mean subtract 5 from your thac0 (equalling a 7) and 
now you roll a 7 or better to hit.
 
SMAUG does the exact same computation, and "die roll". (FYI: A computers base 
number is 0, not 1. So a 20 sided die would be from 0-19, 0 being critical
miss, and 19 being a critical hit) But in order to understand this, you've got 
to be able to figure out what your characters (or mobs) thac0 is.
 
Thac0 for PCs in SMAUG is based on two things: class and level. When you create
a class you give the class two values. A thac0 and a thac32.  No, thac32 does 
not mean "to-hit-armor-class 32". What it does for the game is allows the code 
to calculate the value of a PC's thac0 based on his level. (Technically the 
formula is as follows: thac0+(level*(thac32-thac0)/32)) This however is not the
case for NPC's. NPC's are automatically given a thac0 of 0. This number cannot 
be altered currently without a change to the code.
 
SEE FIRST: HELP ARMOR CLASS
SEE NEXT: HELP HITROLL
~

51 THACO AC~
.
Thaco is determined by a linear interpolation  based upon the current level of 
the character divided by 32 in Smaug. These values are basically used as the
boundaries of the interpolation between 0 and 1, where thaco_00 is at level
0 and thaco_32 occurs at level 32. The thaco inbetween these levels is the
ration of current level to 32.
  In English: Let's say you have a new warrior character, with a Thac0 of 18.
That means, if he is fighting a creature/mob with an armour class of 0, he
has to roll an 18 or over (on a 20 sided die) to hit.
Armour class modifiers work as such:  Hit roll must equal Thac0 - monster's
AC.
If the monster had a negative armour class of say, -2, (which is better),
he'd have to hit his Thac0 (-2), which would be 20, and he could only hit on
a roll of 20. Conversely, the higher the monster's AC , the better the
chances of hitting on any given roll.

1 THALOS~
Recommended level range: 10 - 25

 
Thalos was once the most powerful nation in Despair, a constant thorn
in the side of Darkness, an ever-vigilant defender of Light. It was not
surprising then that, after another victory against Lord Seth's forces,
a magical black mist was unleashed on the city. Any who entered the foul
mist were dead within minutes, poisoned by the deadly vapors. When the
dark cloud lifted, Thalos was left in ruins, its once slavebound lamias
now deadly creatures. A beholder was left to rule over the wreckage.
None have attempted to rebuild Thalos, for they say it is cursed for
all time...
~

1 'THE ASTRAL PLANE' 'ASTRAL PLANE'~
Recommended level range: 15 - 35
 
High above Darkhaven, perched atop a heavenly rainbow, is the ever-
standing pearly gate to the Astral Plane. Once a gateway between worlds
and planes, it is now a black void which is connected to but one world.
The Astral Plane's inhabitants do provide much intrigue however, even if
their homeland does not. The githyanki, as they are called, were once humans
enslaved by the mind flayers of Shadowport. Led by the Lady Gith, they
escaped, yet their minds and bodies were so tortured that they were no
longer accepted openly among humans. Using new psionic powers, they quickly
dominated the Astral Plane. Since then, a powerful lich has become the
ruler of the race. None know the fate of the Lady Gith, although many
speculate that she lost or refused to fulfill a bargain she made with dark
powers to free her race...
~

1 THE DESERT OF DESPAIR~
Adventurers will undoubtedly stumble on the Desert of Despair on their journies
around New Thalos and the sands of the Blasted Lands. An earthquake which
struck the lands around New Thalos have opened a chasm separating the Emerald
Hills and the thriving city.  At the same time, sightings of a new Oasis and a
hidden temple in the midst of the Blasted Lands bring hope to the brave of new
treasure and adventure.  Adventurers may find traces of the sands of Despair
spread throughout their formerly well-known territories.
 
Level range: 25 - 50
~

1 'THE SHIRE'~
Recommended level range: 5 - 35
 
The Shire is a small village of halflings and hobbits to the northwest
of Darkhaven.  The town is run by the Thain, who also manages the trade
of wheat with other towns.  Very little danger exists in the Shire,
save for the occasional thieving youth, or angry bull.                         
~

1 THE_PANEL~
The Panel are a group of immortals who are responsible for dealing with
complaints regarding the disciplining of mortals by Immortals.  Their
role is to review what has occured, the punishment allocated and all
of the relevant circumstances and to determine if the punishment given
is too excessive.  Due to the sensitivity of their job function, and 
the fact that members of the panel may change over time, their identities
are not broadcast to the Realms at large.  To launch an appeal please

0 THIEF THIEVES~
The thief is a dark character which makes use of many skills often deemed
... improper by the rest of society.

The skills of the thief reflect his way of life, be it sneaking, peeking
into others' inventories, picking locks, or attacking from behind with
deadly backstabs.  With amazing dexterity they have the ability to circle
around an enemy to deliver devastating blows.

But for living such a dark life, thieves have always had a bad reputation
so don't be suprised if you are always under suspicion.

Thieves start off fairly weak, but as they gain skills such as backstab and
circle they soon become dangerous foes.  A thief is always useful when there
is a lock that needs to be pried, an item that one wishes to acquire without
detection, or a particularly wicked foe whose downfall requires cunning.
 
The following races are acceptable to the ways of the Thief:
Human Elf Dwarf Halfling Pixie Half-Ogre Half-Orc Half-Troll Half-Elf Gith
Drow Sea-Elf Gnome

0 TICK~
Many of the actions in the Realms are based upon interval timers, including
combat, most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell
duration, weather, and area resetting.
 
Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks in these Realms average 60 seconds of real time, but the
actual amount varies randomly from 45 seconds to 75 seconds.
 
Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if there are no characters
in the area; less often (15 minutes) if any characters are present; Also,
some lower level areas have shorter reset periods, while some higher level
areas have longer reset periods.
 
Note that objects lying on the ground will not be regenerated if anyone is
in the area when it resets.
 
Area resets are indicated by 'squeaking noises' or other messages just prior
to the reset itself.

51 TILDE~
The tilde character is a very handy feature to use when formatting text with
the editor. It is good style to use as much buffer space as possible when 
creating room descs, making mobs echo with mob programs, or trying to present
your ideas in readable form.
  
&WAn example :
  
&Gmpat 0.$n mea 0.$n _lbl Edmond's mob says 'This is a very short line to use
mpat 0.$n mea 0.$n _lbl because the preface of the command is sooooo long.'
  
will yield you :
&CEdmond's mob says 'This is a very short line to use
&Cbecause the preface of the command is sooooo long.'
  
&GWouldn't it be nice to see :
&CEdmond's mob says 'This is a very short line to use because the preface of the command is sooooo long.'
  
&GTo do just that, I simply add the tilde to the end of the first line and
remove the second command preface. &WExample as follows:
&G
mpat 0.$n mea 0.$n _lbl Edmond's mob says 'This is a very short line to use - 
because the preface of the command is sooooo long.'
  
There are however some catches to working with this feature. The primary catch
is that when re-editing a file that uses the tilde character, each line that 
used the tilde, will need to be reformatted, as well as the original line below
it. Using the example from above, when going back into buffer, the text would
look like the following : 
  
1> mpat 0.$n mea 0.$n _lbl Edmond's mob says 'This is a very short line to use bec
2> use the preface of the command is sooooo long.'
  
Using the tilde would be considered an advanced editor technique. If you are
going to use it, it is generally easier to format your text in an offline
editor such as Windows notepad, or zMUD's editor.

51 TIMER~
&G
31 to 40                "is lying here."
23 to 30                "is buzzing with flies."
15 to 22                "fills the air with a foul stench."
07 to 14                "is crawling with vermin."
01 to 06                "is in the last stages of decay."
 
Since a corpse decays over 30 to 40 minutes, the best practice
is to wait until the corpse timer is 23 or less (or has hit the
"fills the air with a foul stench." stage.
 
You can see what stage of decay a corpse is in by typing:
 - bodybag <player name>              (i.e. bodybag Joemort)
 - atobj 'corpse <player name>' look  (i.e. atobj 'corpse Joemort' look)
 - ostat <player name>                (i.e. ostat Joemort)

0 TOWER 'TOWER OF DESPAIR' 'THE TOWER OF DESPAIR'~
Recommended level range: 35 - 50
 
The dark Tower of Despair has existed for many ages as a black spike 
that corrupts the landscape west of Darkhaven. The God Strahd created 
this monstrosity, a gift to his most loyal servant: Orcus, Demon Prince 
of Death. The early ages of Despair were plagued by his dreaded minions 
and the undead walked the land. Orcus was without a doubt the most powerful 
evil in the Realms until he crossed the legendary Zarkas. Wielding the lost 
blade Nemesis, the Ancient Vampire Lord forced Orcus back to his abode and 
sealed the Lord of Undeath in his tower. Though Orcus is forever imprisoned, 
he still influences Despair to this day. Rumors, recently confirmed, tell 
that he has even managed to capture a solar, a being of pure Light.
~

1 'TOWER OF ENLIGHTENMENT'~
Recommended level range: 35 - 50

The Tower of Enlightenment is situated near Lord Seth's Fortress, a
beautiful sight compared to the Dread Demigod's castle. Little is known
about this monument to knowledge, although many speculate that a tour 
of the tower can bless an adventurer with a crude understanding of the
multiverse. Some even say that the Infidel, Circe, has crafted under-powered
forms of some of the Lost Gods and sentenced them here to give adventurers
a feeling of godly might.

1 TOWN HALL TOWNHALL~
&G
&WThe Main Lobby of the Darkhaven Town Hall is located one east and
one south of Darkhaven Square. From there, you can read the directory
(Type "&YLOOK DIRECTORY&W), to find the Mayor's Office, The Archives,
Judge Kendra (Darkhaven Supreme Court), The Mail Room, Oracle and
many other offices.
~

1 'TOWN HALL'~
Recommended level ranges: 0 - 60
Darkhaven's latest architectural feat was in a sense, a prank at first.
The deity Elcid looked upon the old Town Hall, and decided unto himself
that is was too easily accessible. So it was with his keen mind that he
created the New Town Hall. At first it was a maze of tricks and traps,
mostly harmless fun until Brontrel looked down upon this and instilled
Order unto the Hall. Now it is a place where all may meet and talk of
that which interests them. Many boards covering all subjects lie scattered
through the three floors of the hall, along with meeting rooms where such
councils may be convened. Upon the first floor, the Mayor and the Judge of
Darkhaven reside, and the top floor was taken over by the Symposium to
better relations between mortals and immortals alike.
~

1 'TOWN OF SOLACE'~
Recommended level range: 5 - 50

The town of Solace lies to the northwest of Darkhaven, attainable through
a path in Haon Dor. It is one of the five cities of Light and has fiercely
defended its territory for ages with the aid of the famed Mandor and Nelson.
An interesting quirk of Solace's citizens is that they do not believe in the
use of magic or the aid of the Gods. They are the meaning of the word warrior.
All are advised to keep this in mind when challenging the city's finest.

Trance places your character in a trance-like state during which mana can
be rapidly regenerated.  Once you begin trancing you cannot engage in other
activities (or type other commands) or you will break the trance state.

until you are at your maximum.
 
Trancing regenerates mana more rapidly than meditation.

1 TRANSYLVANIA~
Recommended level range: 35 - 50
 
Transylvania was once a populated isle floating in the vast Sea of
Sorrows. Its people were strong and hard-working, ruled by an honorable
Prince. Its fate was decided when the ancient Inconnu elder, Dracula,
was overcome by a malevolent entity and abandoned his clan. It 
is thus that he came to Transylvania.  The land's people slowly began
disappearing, replaced with vampiric minions and leeches. In the end,
the Transylvanian Prince fled, leaving the living that remained to die,
and then live in undeath. A small number of individuals still fight
the darkness in this hopeless land. The Count Dracula, as he is now
known, has taken up residence in a manor in the northern part of the
realm, commanding his minions from his lair. It is rumored that he has
been killed many times, only to rise again; for he is cursed and Vl'arescht
refuses his soul in all the higher planes.

1 TREE LIFE 'THE TREE OF LIFE' 'TREE OF LIFE'~
Recommended level range: 35 - 49
 
It was this Tree that the essence of magic wove ages ago, after the
planes of the multiverse were destroyed by Dominus. From the Tree of
Life grew the beginnings of existence on Despair, from the lowliest
insect to the wisest of sages. Many have visited the Tree even after
its destruction by travelling through a magical portal which links
the present and the past. Those who return speak of many powerful
entities which combine many elements of life.
~

1 'TREE OF LIFE'~
Recommended level range: 35 - 50


The origin of all life on Despair can be traced back to the Tree of Life.
Weaved by the essence of magic ages ago, the Tree grew the beginnings of
all existence; from the lowliest insect to the wisest of sages. Many have
visited the Tree through a magical portal leading into the past from the
present, those who return speak of many powerful entities who reside there.
~

1 TREETOPS CANOPY~
Recommended level range: 25 - 40


The treetops of Haon Dor rise high into the air, offering a splendid
view of the surrounding landscape. Though a very pretty place, it is
also riddled with danger. Huge rocs, spider monkeys and living plants
abound here, all seeking sustenance. Like many other places in the
Realms of Despair, attempts to clean out these vermin have been
unsuccessful.
~

1 TREMERE~
"Yes, we know the truth. The truth is that knowledge is not power -- it
is the prelude to power. Knowledge lets us see what is really important
and, most importantly, how to attain it.
 
Power is, after all, what really matters. Power is not a means to end --
it is the end. Power is what makes our unlives worth living. Power is what
gives the night meaning."
 
Majesty and mystery -- the two words are synonymous with the word "Tremere."
Born of murder and greed, created for power and destruction, they are the most
magickal of the clans. Rumors persist of the dark history of the clan; of
tales of diablerie and usurping unequalled. Meanwhile, peasants whisper
fearfully of an even darker future for this cabal of magi.
 
"Magicians are those who are commonly called evil-doers on account of
the enormity of their crimes. They stir up the elements, disturb men's
minds and, without any poisonous potion, they destroy by the mere force
of incantation."
  --Isidore of Seville, Etymologiae
~

54 TRIGGER~
A trigger is an action, phrase, or game event that causes a program
held within a room, mob or object, to begin playing out its commands.
 
Triggers can be anything from a player or mob entering a room, to a
player stating a particular phrase within a room, or to a mob or an
object.

1 'TROLL DEN'~
Recommended level range: 10 - 20

A small group of trolls resides in the darker regions of Haon Dor.
These filthy creatures often wander the forest, seeking lone adventurers
to knock unconscious and bring back to their den for dinner. Though
they do not number many, their numbers appear to be multiplying at a
fast rate...

0 'TROLLISH VIGOR' TROLLISH VIGOR~
Syntax: c troll <target>

~

1 TROLLTOWN~
&GRising from the ruins of an old mountain, the fortress of the Half-Trolls
stands in dark splendor. The fortress is surrounded by a deep moat full of
vicious beasts, and guarded by some of it's own. Lying northeast of the
fabled Mount Doom, the Half-Trolls have made a home for themselves. The
fortress contains a small city, complete with shops, lounges and other
conviences which make this hardy race comfortable in this harsh environment.

~

1 TRUE 'TRUE SIGHT'~
Syntax:  cast 'true sight'
 
True sight confers the caster with a very brief immunity to blindness
(from attacks such as gouge or the blindness spell itself).  While
under the spell's effect, the caster continues to see.  Be warned
that when the spell wears off the caster will become blind should
the effects of the blinding attack still remain.
 
True sight cannot be cast upon anyone but the caster themselves.
~

60 TRUST~
Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.

1 TUMBLE~
Syntax:  operates independently
 
Tumble is a high-level thief skill for the evasion of incoming attacks.
The skill functions autonomically, and its effectiveness is greater for
more dexterous thieves.
 
~

2 TUMULT~
&G
A young half-troll named Volamchenko braved the perils of the Sands of
Time and the icy chill of the Blizzard Bridge to pledge his sword to the
Old Man, Father Time himself.  Volamchenko pledged to guard the borders of
Father Time's Manse from the foul Malsangre, who still hunts the Old Man.
Pleased with the young half-troll's dedication and after ascertaining no
taint of Infernalism, Father Time accepted Volamchenko's pledge of fealty.
The Old Man gifted Volamchenko with a fragment of his power to aid against
intruders.

Upon being sent to the borders of Time's demense, Volamchenko created a rift
to the Astral Plane and welcomed Malsangre to the land she was forbidden to
ever set foot in.  Volamchenko had been Malsangre's unwitting dupe.  Upon the
receipt of power from the Old Man, Malsangre had seized mental control of the
young half-troll and broken the seal preventing her entrance to the Sands of
Time.  

Quickly learning of the breach, Father Time played a desperate gambit and
seized control of Volamchenko's mind, forcing the young half-troll to throw
the demoness into the rift and close it.  Taken unaware, Malsangre tumbled
screaming back to the Astral Plane.

His mind shattered through the barrage of intrusions, Volamchenko opened a rift
into the timestream.  Cursing both Malsangre and the old man, Volamchenko
rushed through the rift and vanished.

Volamchenko now dwells within the Tumult of the Timestream.  His rifts
sporadically open between worlds, gathering objects of power and potential
allies to destroy Malsangre and unseat the Old Man.  However in his dementia
Volamchenko fails to realize he is caught in a time loop, with each acquisition
vanishing soon after it is attained.  While his derangements may prevent him
from taking heed of his loss, it does not impede his zeal to avenge himself.

1 UNDERWORLD  'THE UNDERWORLD'~
Recommended level range:  30 - 50
 
Far beneath the surface of the earth, beneath even the dwellings of the
dwarves, is the Underworld. Located near the center of the world of Despair,
it is a realm of fire, brimstone and ash.  Flows of lava are common and the
heat of this dread place has been known to kill the weak of heart. Hideous
beings populate the Underworld, led by Satan. None know where she arose from,
though many speculate that she is a powerful entity with dominance over death.
~

59 UNFOLDAREA~
Syntax:  unfoldarea <area filename>

NOTE:  It could be quite dangerous to unfold an area that is already
       loaded, or one that has not been tested.
 
~

1 'UNHOLY GROUNDS'~
Recommended level range: 5 - 15

As you walk through this hellish cemetery, before the graves of those torn
from life before their time, you can hear the mournful cries of those
left behind.  A bell tolls in the distance, announcing the passing of
yet another lost soul.  A preacher speaks from a shoddy chapel, giving
hollow words of comfort to the mourners gathered there.  The vileness of
this place permeates your clothing, attacking your every sense.  Ghoulish
corpses littering the ground, unholy statues with the heads of gargoyles,
and a vile mausoleum filled with bloody carcasses rotting away - these are
the visions which assault your mind.
~

1 'UNRAVEL DEFENSE'~
Syntax: c 'unravel defense' <victim>
 
This spell renders the victim susceptible to both magic and nonmagic attacks.

51 UPDATE~
For most of Saturday (1/2/99) and into Sunday morning Realms of
Despair was up, but wizlocked. The is probably the longest period
of "down time" this mud has experienced in years.  Our relative
stability is no doubt part of the reason we've grown to the size
we have.  Unfortunately, that size can cause its own problems,
and in this case exacerbate any problem that appears.
 
Over the past several months the game server has been experiencing
a variety of problems.  We are exceedingly grateful to Idirect for
supplying us with our server and T3 connection, but we are left to
do most of the troubleshooting remotely.  No easy task in this case:
the machine is a Cyrix 166 w/128megs of ram, supports one of the
largest muds on the net with astonishing traffic, hosts a variety of
lists and is the home server of game.org which includes the Realms
page, the Smaug pages and ftp.game.org - all extremely high-traffic
sites.
 
Still, the little machine has performed admirably.  Contrary to what
some may grumble about, cpu load is rarely a problem.  Disk load is
a far larger consideration most times.  The mud itself rarely lags as
a result of the server load except when we're doing something like the
daily log runs, compiling for extended periods of time, etc.
 
Continued in 'help update2'
~

51 UPDATE2~
All that said, the server's problems have been a continuing headache
punctuated by significant migraines.  A "temporary pwipe" several
weeks ago was such a thing, and what happened Saturday was another
example.  This time, however, the sheer size of the game and the
nature of the problem presented additional trouble.  In addition to
various system files being corrupted, a large number of pfiles were
mangled (large defined as possibly numbering in the triple digits).
 
In light of this, it was decided to keep the mud up but wizlocked
until we could a) restore all pfiles from recent backups and b) be
relatively certain that after we did such a thing we wouldn't have
the same problem occur again immediately.  We also needed to rebuild
the various corrupted system files.
 
Hence, we were "down" (up, but wizlocked) for about 20 hours.
 
A new server is in the works, but we can't give a date for its arrival.
We're looking forward to it as much as the players are, and while we
have not necessarily needed the additional horsepower it will provide
we've already started drooling over the possibilities for future
additions.
 
Read on for what this incident means to you.
 
Continued in 'help update3'
~

51 UPDATE3~
"Will my character be the same?"
... all characters were restored from their most recent 'quit'.
This means that if you were on for 12 hours prior you may have
lost that 12 hours of work.  In general, the vast majority of
characters will see little difference between the way they are
now and when they were last online.
 
"Can we get reimbursements?"
... possibly, but to even be considered you _MUST_ write to the
Oracle and you must be as detailed as possible.  See 'help boards'
if you don't know the location of the Oracle (a second oracle has
also been placed just west of Sonoria temporarily).
 
"What if I gripe or whine or make a bunch of sarcastic comments to
imms in tells and on channels about this?"
... I'll probably hear about it, and right now the last thing I need to
hear after spending my holiday weekend working for free to fix this
free game after our free server chopped itself into tiny bits is this
kind of thing.  I'll probably just delete you.
 
"What if we can't get a reimbursement, don't I have the right to
gripe about how stupid it all is on channels and at imms then?"
... you've been backed up about as well as you can be, probably 
from no more than a few hours to almost immediately before the
problem occured.  You've already got the best we can do.  I'll
probably just delete you.
 
Continued in 'help update4'
~

51 UPDATE4~
"Did someone hack the server?"
... Nope, but I've already heard at least four people claim credit
for it.  I feel like a reporter listening to terrorist groups taking
credit for a natural gas explosion at an embassy.
 
 
A few final comments and warnings:

- It's a good bet that the next 24 hours or so after we open up 
we'll be "unstable" as we get players logging on and playing again.
I'm sure there's some fallout left over that we just haven't found.
We may crash here or there, but should be back up shortly afterward.
In the meantime, be careful.
 
- I cannot stress enough that if you want to stay on Realms this would
be an incredibly bad time to bellyache on channels.
 
- Please don't ask us when the new server is arriving.  We really have
no idea.  The best answer we can give is "soon" ... we're extremely
grateful for our sponsors and we are here through their generosity.
 
- If you have any questions at all, please email them to
blodkai@game.org and I'll answer them as I have time.
 
Our apologies for the down time.  Enjoy the game.

1 UPLIFT~
Syntax:  c uplift <target>
 
Uplift is a cleric spell that can heal from afar, meant to be used in 
aiding players with negative hitpoints.
Uplift is not to be used as your common mode of healing.  Repeatedly asking
for uplifts on public channels is spammy and annoying for other players.  
Keep in mind that the clerics that are uplifting you are doing so out of 
kindness.  Do _not_ abuse it or consider it a right.
~

1 UPPERCUT~
Syntax:  uppercut
 
From the gut, a fisted hand is driven up through your opponents jaw. If
successfully landed, this attack can inflict a sizeable amount of damage
to the primary opponent. NOTE: This skill may be used to start fights so
should not be used on your fellow players unless under pkill conditions.
~

54 USEPROG~
Syntax: opedit <object> <command> [number] [use_prog] [percentage]
 
The use_prog is an objtrigger that can be used in object programs.  The
use_prog will be executed when the item is used.  To define what will
trigger the use_prog, here is a list:

* Wands - when you zap
* Staves - when you brandish
* Food/pills - when you eat
* Blood/fountains/drink containers - when you drink
* Lights/armour/weapons - when you wear/wield/hold
* Potions - when you quaff
* Pipes - when you smoke
 
When the use_prog is executed you will not see the standard 'use message'
(ie You quaff a violet potion). What you will will be any mpechoes placed
in the program.  Also, any mobprog commands can be used in use_prog (see 
MPCOMMANDS).

**NOTE** The use_progs on lights, armour, and weapons are executed BEFORE
the player wears/holds/wields any item. Therefore, a mpforce to remove the
item will not work in the use_prog.  You will have to use a wear trigger
to accomplish this.
~

54 USERS~
Syntax: users <host ip>
Syntax: users <playername>

USERS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including users
in the process of logging in.
If used with an argument, it will show all users from that host ip.
Shortforms of host will work -- e.x. 205, or 205.113, etc.
Shortened names will also work.  e.x., users fre would show
Fredrick and Fred if they were on at the time.
The first number, (desc), is the descriptor number that this user is on.
The second number is the user's connected state.  (See CONSTATES)
The third number is the number of seconds the user has been idle.

1 'VALE OF NIDAROS' NIDAROS~
Deep within a secluded valley lies a retreat for the gnomes of the realm to
keep them safe from those who would persecute them. Tucked away between the
mountains lies Nidaros, created by the heroine Delisse and populated by gnomes
who find the solitude welcome. The once small town has grown into a bustling
center of magic and the gnomes specialize in creating and copying spells for
selling to the realms. Quiet folk, they are often called upon to bring justice
and to mediate between other races, as well as teaching chosen ones in their
academy. The glade welcomes all gnomes who are of peaceful intent, however,
traitors are not looked upon kindly.

0 VALIANCE~

1 'VALLEY OF THE ELVES'~
Recommended level range: 5 - 20

The Valley of the Elves lies far to the north of Darkhaven, beyond the
great Mount Olympus. The tribal, uncivilized elves of Despair reside
in the valley, oblivious to all the pain and destruction which occurs
while they sing, dance and hunt. A single elf is involved in aiding
the forces of Light: Talemon the Archmage. Trained at the High Tower
of Sorcery and considered noble by all, he is well-respected in
courts throughout the Realms and his insight has often saved many lives.
~

0 VAMPIRE VAMPIRES~
Vampires are one of the powerful creatures of the Realms.  Being a
creature of the undead, they require copious quantities of fresh
blood.  Instead of using mana, Vampires use blood points (bp) for
spell casting and some skill use.

If a Vampire takes a large amount of damage, blood points will be
lost, but blood points can give a small surge of hit points (hp) in
battle when needed.

As an undead creature of the night, Vampires receive an armor class
(ac) bonus at night, a time when they can use the skill mistwalk to
travel across vast stretches of the Realms in an instant.
 
The following races are acceptable to the ways of the Vampire:
Human Elf Dwarf Halfling Half-Ogre Half-Orc Half-Troll Half-Elf Gith Drow

51 VENTRUE~
"Therefore with the same necessity with which the stone falls to earth,
the hungry wolf buries its fangs in the flesh of its prey, without the
possibility of the knowledge that it itself is the destroyed as well as
the destroyer"             -Schopenheuer
 
 
Freedom? You babble to me of freedom? You, who dance to the strings of 
puppeteers so vile and so manipulative that you would destroy every
symbol of your old existence at their slightest twitch? You, who scream 
and fight and brawl all night long, draining not only mortals but the
mortal world until it has nothing left to give?
   You deserve no freedom. You deserve only contempt. Where were you when
we built this city? Where were you when we battled the Sabbat? Where were
you when the nights promised nothing but treachery and blood? Freedom
belongs to those who earned it. For you, the only freedom is death.
 
Old-fashioned and tradition-bound, Ventrue are sophisticated and genteel;
they are cautious, honorable, social and elegant Kindred. They are most
frequently the leaders in the Camarilla, and most often found among the
uppercrust of the mortal world, most mingling and fitting in quite well.
Their sophistication stands them in good stead among the elite of mortal
society, and it allows them to control many of the more powerful members 
of the city. Because of the relative ease in which most travel among such
company, the Ventrue often have a monopoly on the political control of the
city.

1 'VILLAGE OF EDO'~
Recommended level range: 35 - 50

To the northwest of Thalos is a small village populated by fierce
warriors. For years, the warriors of Edo have been training their art
of self-defence and attack. They have finally accomplished their holy
quest and have now joined the five cities of Light in the battle against
Evil. Though they do not have the numbers to contribute, the training
they provide largely outweighs this inconvenience.

1 VISIONARY CONSORTIUM~
Rumors abound as to the history and function of this Council. Many believe that
it is but a myth, while other more astute individuals recognize signs of the
workings of the Visionary Consortium in their daily wanderings around the
Realm. Immortals demonstrating a sense of spectral reverie are recognized and
encouraged to join the inner workings of the Visionary Consortium, working 
closely with the mystical Elders, Coders, and the council of gifted mortals 
known as 'The Symposium' to ensure that visions with merit are taken from being
a concept to becoming a reality.
 
To submit your ideas regarding improvements for the Realms, post them in the
Town Hall on the Board of Conception, mudmail to any Visionary Consortium 
member, or speak to your Symposium representative.
Builders should see 'help build' and all the linked files for further
information in regards to the ideas for and creation of new areas.

1 VOTING VOTE VOTES~
Syntax: note vote <number> open/ballot/close/yes/no/abstain
 
Once a note has been posted on a bulletin board, the author may open voting
with 'note vote <number> open/ballot'.  All those who can read the board may
then vote on the issue in the note with 'note vote <number> yes/no/abstain'.
The author may close the voting; the syntax for that should be clear enough.
 
Note list will show whether a note is not a voting note, open to voting or
closed to voting.  The character that separates the author and the recipient in
'note list' will be a colon, a capital V/B or a capital C accordingly.

1 WAR WARTALK~
Syntax:  war <message>
 
Wartalk is a channel created as a haven for those players who like to openly
discuss their exploits in combat - and brag against their opponents.  It is
most often used for those who declare war on other deadlies and is desirable
for those who like to invite others to battles in player versus player
whether it be in the arena or around the Realms.
 
Wartalk can only be seen by deadly players, but has the same rules as do
other channels:  no harassment, profanity, spamming or inappropriate
subject matter.  We try to be lenient with wartalk enforcement, but don't
go overboard.

0 WARRIOR WARRIORS~
Warriors are the quintessential fighters, able to use all types of
weaponry and armour in the exercise of their most lethal of combat
skills.  There is no greater physical combatant.

A warrior must be strong in body to survive his dangerous lifestyle,
and though he has no magic and limited skills he is nevertheless one
of the most formidable forces in all the Realms.

Warriors learn no magic, and have no use for mana.
 
The following races are acceptable to the ways of the Warrior:
Human Elf Dwarf Halfling Half-Ogre Half-Orc Half-Troll Half-Elf Gith Sea-Elf

&W Syntax: &G watch print 500 100    &W Shows 100 lines starting at line 500

Watch will work 24 hours a day from the time you put a watch on a player until
you take it off. You can also watch all players from a specific site.
 
We need you to be real careful about the size of your watch file. If you
are watching a number of players or sites, please do not just forget about
your watches and allow your watch file to grow to outrageous sizes. You
should never have more than 5,000 or 10,000 lines in your watch file.
If you are doing some watching, be sure you check your watch file daily
and either print it, display it, copy it to your hard drive or do whatever
you need to do with it but then ... please ... please ... be sure you
clear it so that it don't grow huge and eat up all our hard drive space.
If you clear your watch file daily ... there should be no problem. If you
aren't watching anyone ... you don't have to worry about this. But if you
start a watch, it is your responsibility to know how big your watch file
is and to stop the watch when you no longer need it. The command
&G"watch size" &W tells you how many lines are in your watch file.
The command &G"watch clear"&W clears (deletes) your watch file.
For the time being the maximum number of lines you can display at one time
is 1000. So ... even if you have 5,000 lines in your watch file ... you can
only display 1,000 at a time.

1 WEAPONS~
Weapons are the primary source of fighting power for most classes,
especially at lower levels where other skills and spells remain
unlearned. To use a weapon, simply 'wield <weapon name>'. You will
hit more frequently with a weapon which is suited to your class, so
choose your weapon wisely. For instance, mages use short blades at 95%
efficiency. A mage wielding a long blade would hit his/her target less
frequently, dependant upon the hitroll of the weapon in hand. Also, be
sure to practice and adept your favored weapontype for best results.

1 'WEDDING' 'MARRIAGE'~
***To officially be married you must be Avatar level.
If you wish to get married, you are responsible for supplying your own
rings. You must seek the mayor in the Town hall to purchase a license.
Once you have your license, if you desire to customize your rings you must
seek out Blorin, the Darkhaven engraver in the Town Hall.  He will be able to
help you out.  If you would like something other than what Blorin offers, it
will cost you each glory to rename your rings.
  Once your rings are ready and both bride and groom can arrange a time
to be online for the ceremony, you must find someone to officiate the
wedding ceremony.  Who do you ask to do this?  A good friend, a
person belonging to the Clerics Guild, an Avatar, or an Immortal.
You will find that Immortals are often too busy to perform the wedding
ceremony, so you should really try for a mortal as your officiant.
 
If you are the mortal performing the wedding, you may ask an Immortal
to echo the announcement of the wedding, including the bride and groom's
name and the location.  You may also ask an Immortal to make a
congratulatory echo welcoming the newly married couple into the Realms.
 
The contents of the ceremony is determined between the bride, groom, and
officiant. The ceremony can be playful, serious, or anywhere in between.
The wedding may be held most anyplace, but if you want good attendance, it
should be in a place easy to get to.  You are welcome to consult an Immortal
if you have any questions.

0 WIMPY~
Syntax:  wimpy
Syntax:  wimpy <value>
Syntax:  wimpy max
 
This command sets your wimpy value.  When your character takes damage that
reduces your hit points below your wimpy value, you will automatically
attempt to flee.
                                                      
'Wimpy' by itself sets your wimpy to about 20% of your maximum hitpoints.
 
'Wimpy <value>' allows you to set your wimpy at a level you determine,
but it cannot exceed about 75% of your maximum hitpoints.
 
'Wimpy max' sets your wimpy at its maximum level for you.
 
Some monsters are wimpy.

to incorporate learning.  Among other things, it affects:

 - the mana a character gains each time it levels, though intelligence
   affects this much more heavily
 
 - the percentage a character learns of a new language at each practice,
   though intelligence affects this slightly more
 
 - the ability to remove a trap or poison a weapon
 
Wisdom is the prime attribute of druids, clerics and augurers.

51 WIZHELP~
Syntax: wizhelp

WIZHELP provides a list of all the immortal commands.
~

51 WIZINVIS~
Immortals have the responsibility to be available to others whenever
possible, be they mortal or immortal.  When the use of wizinvis is
called for, the following are parameters for its use:
 
) Neophytes through Saints (levels 51 through 54) must be visible
  at all times, save for when running a quest or similar circumstance.
 
) Demi through Lesser gods may invis to any level at their discretion
  subject to the following guidelines:  it is considered mandatory to
  be visible to all other immortals whenever reasonably able to do so.
  Using wizinvis beyond 51 to facilitate work on a project, allow
  concentration on something, avoid excessive tells or the like is
  fine, but it should only be used while necessary.  The higher your
  level, the more leeway you have in this ... a Demi should be much
  more conservative than a lesser.
 
) Gods and higher may invis to any level at their discretion

Guidelines for use of wizinvis beyond 51 in immortal channels:  the
rule of thumb is to be wizinvis no higher than the lowest imm on that
channel (54 on Muse, 51 in Immtalk, etc.)  As above, the higher your
level the greater the leeway.

0 WYVERN 'WYVERN TOWER' 'WYVERNS TOWER'~
Recommended level range: 15 - 35
 
Crafted ages ago from the black magics of an evil cult, the Wyvern's Tower
was conquered two decades ago by the forces of Light. They set the tower on 
fire and left, believing that holy fire would finish the deed of purging the 
evil of the place. However, only months after, many races of Darkness began 
creeping back, making the tower's hallowed halls their home once again. The 
forces of Light, unfortunately, have not the time to deal with such minor 
threats. So, a group powerful enough to completely destroy the creatures 
within the tower has never risen to the challenge. The Wyvern's Tower has 
been used of late for training and testing of new initiates of Good.

1 ZENOTHIR 'THE TOWER OF ZENOTHIR'~
Recommended level range: 15 - 25
 
In the dwarven forest to the southeast of Darkhaven is a small village
and tall tower. Residing in the tower is, of course, Zenothir, a famed
magician who made his fortune with the magical art of illusion and 
trickery. Other practitioners of this art have flocked to this tower and
founded a small village around it, although some say it is more a circus
than village. Although it is a well known fact that Zenothir has taken up the
cause of Good, these followers firmly believe that those who impress the
great mage sufficiently will be rewarded with his infinite knowledge of 
illusionary magic.

pulling sensation as strange and colorful mists swirl around you...
