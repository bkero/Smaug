Title    Stability returns ... ?~
Name     Realms~
Date     05/08/02~
Type     0
POST     One of the more unstable periods we've had for a while has hopefully
been put behind us.  The problem was obscure, and was not related to
new code but to the first-ever heavy use of existing code.  While
the crashes were frustrating to us all, some things just don't
rear their ugly heads until 500+ characters are thrown into the mix.
 
This code is powerful and extremely flexible, and gives us the
ability to do things we couldn't dream of in the past.  The brief
problems will have been well worth it.  Of course there always
exists the potential for a crash, but the string of them we've
experienced over the past few days from this problem have
been highly unusual.  (Sometimes we forget what it's like to have
been running stable for so long.)
 
Many thanks to Thoric, Altrag and Edmond for their attention to
and eventual resolution of the problem.

Type     0
POST     It is with a somber heart that I proclaim, on this the Day of Thunder,
3rd the Month of Nature, on the moist earth of our Village the lifeblood
of a goddess was spilled.
  Earlier in the night, a being known as Pseulak appeared in town.  She
spoke blasphemously of our gods and beseeched others to follow it.  When
a suitable crowd had gathered, Pseulak lashed out and killed all within
reach.  Wave after wave of hero threw themselves at Pseulak, but with
each blow Pseulak returned more powerful.
   After the battle was waged for an hour, the goddess Nae'trelle, fair in
her beauty, arrived and came to our aid.  She healed and blessed those
who fled the battle.
   But then Pseulak slipped from the battle and came face to face with the
goddess.  A harsh exchanges of words flew between them.  Then suddenly, Pseulak
lashed out with a wicked sharp claw and slit the throat of Nae'trelle.  The
ground shook with her death keen as her blood poured to the earth.  As the
quake increased their was a blinding light and all was silent.
   When the light subsided, the corpse of Nae'trelle was gone.  All that
remained was Pseulak and half a dozen of her demonic minions.  Pseulak
fled, leaving the demons to cover his retreat.
 
 
   It is with great sadness that we mourn the loss of the Goddess of Innocence.
Farewell Nae'trelle.

his face it did.  Well, as I was saying, the flames were everywhere.
Then some heroes from Darkhaven arrived, brave souls.  They looked

these things down in the Old Marsh.  Also fought their Lord or some
such who was runnin' rampant in New Thalos.
   Well, as I was saying, the heroes arrived and made short work of
those flames, what with their quantum blast things and their lifeblades
and whatever you call them.  They fought one here in my own shop.
Terrifyin' it was.
  Well, as I was saying, there was a Lord of Fire running around New
Thalos.  It seems he was using these other fires to lure out E'soa.
She used her winds to weaken the flames in the Marsh and here in
Solace.  Then when all the flames were extinguished, he turned to
her and burned her to a crisp.  The skin just rolled right off her

POST     There was a lot of hootin' and hollerin', I remember that.  Aalakab
entered the world promising more power to his undead followers through
some ritual charm he invented.  So like a bunch of damn fools, all them
Darkhaven heroes run off to help him.  Yeah, help the deity of evil undead
vampires.  Fools.
  Sorry, got off track.  Anyway, fast as you can say glory, these people are
running all over gathering ingredients.  I think Mephie, Zwanth, Asmodeous and
Ferokonon helped him the most.  So Aalakab has all his ingredients, then he
asks for some more things and people blindly rush off and get it for him.
  Then this god shows up right outside my inn in the middle of the Forest.  He
summons all those who helped him while he works his charm.  Apparently the fool
wants to block out the sun and all these other fools just helped him and are
standing around watching.  Well, he does this charm without bothering to make
sure everything he asked for is there.  Seems this Ferokonon fellow left and
he had one of the crucial ingredients.  So instead of this fantastic charm to
block out the sun, we get Mahsstrac this giant dragon.  This dragon was
supposed to block out the sun, see, but since it was missing whatever
Ferokonon was supposed to bring it went nuts.  Flat out berserk.  Breathing
gas and shredding people with its claws.  So then Aalakab steps in thinking
he can stop the thing and SPLAT!  The dragon summons a demon that destroys
him.  That's what you get for mucking with dark magicks and having
undependable help I guess.  And all the rest of you fools, quit helping these
deities.  They are no good I tell you, the lot of them.  You are better off
spending some time at my inn, which has some reduced ale right now.

of power had been stolen from him.  He suspected the only one debauched
enough to attempt this was the God of Sins, Er'res.  Volarh descended
from the heavens to locate Er'res and regain his artifact.  He found
Er'res in search of the Ultimate Sin, which had gone missing from the
heavens.
   The former disciple of my God, Vorus, appeared to Er'res and Volarh.
Vorus disclosed that the artifacts has been shattered and buried deep
within the ground.  Before the deities could react, Vorus was gone.
   The gods sought out mortals to obtain the shattered remains of their
lost artifacts.  A group of twenty completed these tasks swiftly, upturning
the earth around the Abattoir Asylum.
   But Vorus was sly, even moreso that the gods of thievery and sin.  He
poisoned the fragments with foul magick.  Upon their assembly, the immortal
powers of Er'res and Volarh were drained.  As their powers vanished, the
gods made men went mad.  They struck at those who had brought them the
fragments.  The mortals were forced to slay the mortal remains of my god
and Er'res.  I report this with great sadness, for my purpose in the world
is no more.  This is the last entry I will pen before my self-inflicted

   Hours later as my shift came to an end, the last of the fragments were
gathered.  As the goddess emerged from the form of the statue, the divine
sculptress mutated into Wakshaa the godslayer.  While Circe was groggy and
unaware, her powers were drained and she collapsed.  While I did not
see if she survived or not, I can say for sure her powers are gone.

POST     My foolishness this day has greatly cost the Realms.  A pregnant matron
who I now know by the name Lady Yul, approached me in disguise and sold
me poisoned provisions, which I offered up to the goddess Vaiza.
The powerful poisons overcame the goddess, but she seemed still to live.
As I searched frantically through Kontaur trying to find an antidote,
a man approached me and queried as to my frantic state.  I told him of
the horrible fate that had befallen my goddess.  Upon relating the
symptions, he straightaway knew a means to remedy her condition.  But
the items laid too far apart for me to find them alone, so I beseeched
those of Darkhaven for aid.  Straight away they came to me with the
ingredients and I did mix them swiftly.  But the antidote was not an
antidote at all, but a more powerful poison.  Combined the two poisons
overcame Vaiza and she admonished me with her last breath.  The strange
man appeared, proclaimed his name as Wakshaa and told us that he and
the Lady Yul would return for all of us once the gods were fallen.
 
I do not understand this.  It makes no sense.  Surely the gods will
not ignore us in this time of need?  Why do they not strike at these
horrid beings?  Are we no longer worthy?  What will become of us?
I fear my questions will not be answered until it is too late.

his side fought valiantly, they were unable to dispatch H'rugg, the
shadow of all that has died.
   Learning of this battle I rushed to Scryn's side.  The combined
might of Scryn, the avatars and myself demolish H'rugg and his allies.
 
However, the poison which had killed Vaiza was also applied to H'rugg's
weapon.  Though I searched for an antidote, I did not arrive in time.
 
Scryn has passed from the Realms of immortality and we will mourn him.

POST     Through my scrying glass, I observed the cause of strange energies.
Ba'akshai, "The Claws of Night", the Spirit of Raw Violence tore a rift from
his hell dimension into these lands and entered through it into Darkhaven.
Seeking bloodshed many mortals arrived and obliged but several times they
were able to quell the manifestation known as the Hellbringer.
 
Ba'akshai's spike armor was bloodied in many places from the mortals he had
slain but then came the meeting with Omanith whom he had come to challenge.
The ensuing battle did not last long as Ba'akshai called upon ancient evils
which had dwelt in the Abyss biding their time. With these powers he tore
Omanith into the two equal parts of magic and physical combat. Via performing
these dark rituals was Ba'akshai able to then use his combined might and
destroy the first half of Omanith's spirit.
 
Then, Ba'akshai manifested into Malik Harjaq, a 12 armed viking whose awesome
power smote many more mortals and managed to put a final end to Omanith. This
enraged the champions who were gathered and with their combined might were
able to force Ba'akshai into retreat to return to the realm from whence he
came. Although.. Ba'akshai spoke of a time when he might return...
 
I am unsure whether to bide my time or act on what has happened.  Perhaps
it is not too late to accept that offer...

POST     I felt blessed that the deities of magic and battle chose New Ofcol
as the site to erect a ward to defend the gods from the hideous acts of
the Godslayers.  Il'liara and Cru'udakh appeared in a swirling mist and
called for the aid of those loyal to them.
   'Bring us the runic symbols of the elements' Il'liara cried, her soft
lilting voice carrying far across the Realms.  'Bring them to us' she cried,
'that I may erect a ward to defend your gods from the scourge that is upon us'.
Quickly heroes far and wide took up her cause, retrieving the runes from the
depths of the sea and earth, braving winds and fires to succeed.  The symbols
were brought to Il'liara, who was guarded by Cru'udakh.  She worked her magicks
carefully.  A green streak shot in the air and then exploded into the globe of
protection over all of Ofcol.
   From the Plains of the North, Cabal cried out to his brother and sister, 
seeking shelter within their ward.  Though they were hesitant, they agreed to
lower the shield but a moment and allow Cabal passage.  Once Cabal was safely
within the confines of the city, Il'liara restored the ward.
   But then Cabal was surrounded in smoke and from the cloud Pseulak appeared.
Her ruse had gained her entrance through the ward.  Though she was beset by
avatars and Cru'udakh alike, Pseulak managed to drain Il'liara of her powers.
The ward collapsed and Pseulak raised her hands in triumph.  The Godslayers
beaten in past battles rose from the mist, attacking Cru'udakh and the heroes.
   The battle was long and bloody as H'rugg, Ba'akshi and Vorus struck at the
god and his defenders.  One by one the Godslayers were dispelled by the might
of the mortal army.  Each dispersed, vowing to return.  Only Pseulak escaped,

   Though we have saved Cru'udakh, the death of Il'liara has surely been
the most costly death yet.  With her passing, the magicks of the realm
seem to have grown unstable.  The extent is unknown, but we fear the
worst.
   Should any Godslayers return, they will surely have a great advantage.

POST     Though the halls of our Castle are oft filled with excitement, nothing
I have seen in my short years compares to the acts I have seen this night.
 
The foul Orc Grishnakh challenged King Anmect to a duel.  Believing his
foe to have lost all immortal power, Anmect readily accepted.  An
ethereal wall was erected to separate the combatants from the gathering
crowd.  The match was even at first, until Grishnakh unveiled the truth
behind his charade.  His immortal powers remained intact and he slowly
began to use them to crush his for King Anmect.  Wracked with pain and
beaten to a pulp, Anmect refused to yield to the taunt and torture of
the great Orc.
 
Then, through the crowd, stepped Entropen.  He proclaimed himself the
servant of Khaloobh the Voracious and stepped through the ethereal
barrier.  He challenged Grishnakh, who charged into the fray.  Easily
avoiding this charge, Entropen struck Grishnakh from behind, levelling
the Orc in one blow.   The Dark Knight ordered Grishnakh to his knees
and ordered him to beg for his life.  The Orc only spat blood at the
Knight's feet.  Entropen struck again and Grishnakh, tears welling in
his eyes, begged his mother for forgiveness.  With that, Entropen
beheaded Grishnakh, departing before the head of the mighty Orc finished
rolling across the floor.
 
But then, unexpectedly, from the corpse sparks arose and an elven man formed.
